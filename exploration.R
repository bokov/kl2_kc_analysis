**Note:** This is not (yet) a manuscript. We are still at the data 
cleaning/alignment stage and it is far too early to draw conclusions. Rather, 
this is a regularly updated report that I am sharing with you to keep you in the 
loop on my work and/or because you are also working on NAACCR, i2b2, Epic, or 
Sunrise because I value your perspective and perhaps my results might be useful 
to your own work.\\
\\
Only de-identified data has been used to generate these results any dates or 
[`patient_num`](#patient%5Fnum) values you see here are also de-identified (with 
size of time intervals preserved).\\

This portion of the study is under Dr. Michalek's exempt project IRB number 
HSC20170563N. If you are a researcher who would like a copy of the data, please 
email me and I will get back to you with further instructions and any additional
information needed for our records.\\

[Yellow highlights]{.note2self custom-style='note2self'} are items with 
which I know I need to deal soon. Verbatim names of files, variables/elements,
or values are displayed in a special style, `like this`. Data element names are 
in addition linked to a glossary at the end of this document, e.g. 
[`Surgical Oncology`](#e%5Fsurgonc). This is where any relevant cleaning or 
tranformation steps will be described (in progress). Data elements from 
NAACCR usually have a NAACCR ID preceding them, e.g. 
[`1780 Quality of Survival`](#n%5Fqsurv). I try to use the word 'data element' to
describe data in its raw state and 'variable' to refer to analysis-ready data
that I have already processed. Often one variable incorporates information from
multiple data elements. Tables, figures, and sections are also linked from text 
that references them. If you have a Word version of this document, to follow a

#' A recent study of state death records [@PinheiroHighcancermortality2017]
#' reports that among US-born Texans of Hispanic ancestry (7.3 million, 27% of
#' the State's population), annual age-adjusted mortality rates for kidney
#' cancer  are 1.5-fold and 1.4-fold those of non-Hispanic whites for males and
#' females respectively. My goal is to determine whether these findings can be
#' replicated at UT Health (Aim 2) and Massachusetts General Hospital (Aim 3).
#' If there is evidence for an ethnic disparity, I will look for possible
#' _mediators_ of this disparity among socioeconomic, lifestyle, and family
#' history variables (Aim 2a). Otherwise the focus will shift to determining
#' which of these same variables are the best _predictors_ of mortality and
#' recurrence.
#' 
#' At the Clinical Informatics Research Division (CIRD) we operate an i2b2
#' [@MurphyInstrumentinghealthcare2009] data warehouse containing deidentified
#' data for over 1.3 million patients from the electronic medical record (EMR)
#' systems of the UT Health faculty practice and the University Health System
#' (UHS) county hospital. We use the HERON [@AdagarlaSEINEMethodsElectronic2015]
#' extract transform load (ETL) process to link data from multiple sources
#' including copies of monthly reports that the Mays Cancer Center sends to the
#' Texas Cancer Registry with detailed information on cancer cases including
#' dates of diagnosis, surgery, and recurrence along with stage and grade at
#' presentation. My first-pass eligibility query returns `r nrow(dat2a)`
#' patients having one or more of the following in their records: an ICD9 code
#' of 189.0 or any ICD10 code starting with C64; the NAACCR item 
#' [`0400 Primary Site`](`r paste0(urls$dict_naaccr,'#400')`) having a value 
#' starting with C64 (`r fs('n_kcancer')`); or the SEER Primary Site having a 
#' value of `r fs('n_seer_kcancer')`.
#' 
#' My second pass criteria narrow the initial cohort to patients that have
#' NAACCR, defined as having a non-missing `r fs('n_ddiag')` and one or both of
#' `r fs('n_kcancer')` or `r fs('n_seer_kcancer')`. As can
#' be seen from [@tbl:cohortrectype] only `r length(kcpatients.naaccr)` of the
#' patient-set met these criteria and `r nrow(dat2a) - length(kcpatients.naaccr)` 
#' did not. Actually a total of `r sum(!is.na(dat2tte$n_fc))` patients had 
#' NAACCR records but `r sum(!is.na(dat2tte$n_fc)) - length(kcpatients.naaccr)` 
#' of them had kidney cancer documented _only_ in the EMR, but neither 
#' `r fs('n_kcancer')` or `r fs('n_seer_kcancer')` in NAACCR. [Next time I 
#' re-run my i2b2 query I will include all site of occurrence information from
#' NAACCR not just kidney. This will allow me to find out what types of cancer
#' these patients do in fact have.]`r n2s('6')` In 
#' [-@sec:diag; -@sec:surg; -@sec:recur] I identified additional 
#' exclusion criteria which I will implement in the next major revision of 
#' this document.
#' 
#' In [@sec:linkagever] I summarize the evidence that NAACCR and EMR records are
#' correctly matched with each other. In [@sec:reqelmnts] I summarize the 
#' minimum set of NAACCR data elements that is sufficient to replicate my 
#' analysis in an independent NAACCR data set. In [@sec:merging] I report the
#' extent to which the completeness of NAACCR records can be improved by using
#' EMR records of the same patients. In [@sec:descplots] is a technical 
#' demonstration of the data analysis scripts (on a small random sample). In 
#' [@sec:cohorchar] there is a characterization of the full (N=`r nrow(dat2a)`)
#' patient cohort. Finally, in [@sec:nextsteps] I present my plans for 
#' overcoming the data issues I found, replicating the analysis on independent 
#' data, preparing additional variables, and starting work on Aim 1.

# dataprep ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#' # Data preparation {#sec:dataprep}
#' 
#' ## Verifying correct patient linkage {#sec:linkagever}
#' 
#' Since this is the first study at our site to make such extensive use of 
#' combined EMR and NAACCR data, it is important to first validate the data 
#' linkage done by our ETL.
#'
#' The following data elements exist in both NAACCR and the EMR, respectively:
#' date of birth (`r fs('n_dob')` and `r fs('birth_date')`), marital status 
#' (`r fs('n_marital')` and `r fs('e_marital')`), sex (`r fs('n_sex')` and 
#' `r fs('sex_cd')`), race (`r fs('a_n_race')` and `r fs('race_cd')`), and
#' Hispanic ethnicity (`r fs('n_hisp')` and `r fs('e_hisp')`). The agreement 
#' between NAACCR and the EMR is never going to be 100%  with race, Hispanic 
#' ancestry, and marital status expected to be especially variable.
#' Nonetheless, if record linkage is correct, when patient counts for NAACCR and 
#' EMR are tabulated against each of the above variables, then _most_ of the 
#' values should agree.
#' 
#' I confirmed that this _is_ the case for marital status
#' ([@tbl:xc_marital]), sex ([@tbl:xc_sex]), race ([@tbl:xc_race]), and
#' Hispanic ancestry ([@tbl:xc_hisp0]). Furthermore, there are 
#' `r nrow(subset(dat3,is.na(n_dob)))` eligible patients lacking a 
#' `r fs('n_dob')` and only `r length(kcpatients.naaccr_bad_dob)` with a 
#' mismatch between `r fs('n_dob')` and `r fs('birth_date')`. Independent 
#' evidence for correct linkage is that EMR ICD9/10 codes for primary kidney 
#' cancer rarely precede `r fs('n_ddiag')` ([@fig:diag_plot]), EMR surgical 
#' history of nephrectomy and ICD9/10 codes for acquired absence of a kidney 
#' rarely precede `r fs('n_dsurg')` or `r fs('n_rx3170')` ([@fig:surg0_plot0]), 
#' and death dates from non-NAACCR sources (`r fs('e_death')`, `r fs('s_death')`
#' , and `r fs('e_dscdeath')`) rarely precede `r fs('n_vtstat')` 
#' ([@fig:death_plot]).
#' 
#' ## Required NAACCR data elements. {#sec:reqelmnts}
#' 
#' The primary outcome variables I need are date of initial diagnosis, date of 
#' surgery (if any), date of recurrence (if any), and date of death (if any). 
#' The primary predictor variable is whether or not a patient is  Hispanic. 
#' There are many covariates of interest, but these five values are the 
#' scaffolding on which the rest of the analysis will be built.
#' 
#' **I found the following NAACCR elements sufficient for deriving all the above 
#' analytic variables: `r fs('n_hisp')`, 
#' `r fs(v(c_main_naaccr_vars),retfun=knitr::combine_words)`.** More details 
#' about how these were selected can be found in [-@sec:vartrn]. In addition the 
#' following will almost certainly be needed for covariates or mediators: 
#' `r knitr::combine_words(fs(c('n_sex','n_dob','n_marital','n_brthplc')),and='')`,
#' and any field whose name contains `Race`, `Comorbid/Complication`, 
#' `AJCC`, or `TNM`. For crosschecking it will also be useful to have 
#' `r fs('n_mets')`, `r fs('n_fc')`, and `r fs('n_mult')`. Additional items 
#' are likely to be needed as this project evolves, but **the elements listed so
#' far should be sufficient to replicate my analysis on de-identified State or
#' National NAACCR data**.
#' 
#' ## Merging NAACCR and EMR variables {#sec:merging}
#' 
#' EMR records can not only enrich the data with additional elements unavailable 
#' in NAACCR alone, but might also make it possible to fill in missing 
#' `r fs('n_ddiag')`,  `r fs('n_rx3170')` / `r fs('n_dsurg')`, 
#' `r fs('n_drecur')`, and `r fs('n_lc')`  values. It may even be possible to 
#' reconstruct entire records for the `r nrow(dat2a)-length(kcpatients.naaccr)` 
#' kidney cancer patients in the EMR lacking NAACCR records. However, this 
#' depends on how much the EMR and NAACCR versions of a variable agree when 
#' neither is missing.
#' 
# merging EMR and NAACCR -------------------------------------------------------
#' 
#' **Data elements representing date of death and Hispanic ethnicity are in 
#' sufficient agreement ( [@tbl:xc_hisp0] and [-@sec:death] ) to justify merging
#' information from the EMR and NAACCR.** The process for combining them is
#' described in the `r fs('a_tdeath')`, `r fs('a_hsp_strict')`, and 
#' `r fs('a_hsp_broad')` sections of [-@sec:vars] respectively. At this time I 
#' cannot merge diagnosis, surgery, or recurrence-- where data from both sources 
#' is available, EMR dates lag considerably behind NAACCR dates 
#' ( [-@sec:diag; -@sec:surg; -@sec:recur] ) and their variability is probably
#' larger than the effect size. The surgery and recurrence lags might be 
#' because those actual visits are not yet available in the data 
#' warehouse and I am only seeing them as reflected in the patient history 
#' at visits long after the fact. The diagnosis lag may be due to the
#' decision to proceed with surgery often being made based on imaging data,
#' [@pcRodriguez2018] with definitive pathology results only available after 
#' surgery ([-@sec:surg]). Attempting to merge these elements would bias the data 
#' and obscure the actual differences. However there are several ways forward 
#' that I will discuss in [@sec:nextsteps] below.
#' 
#' EMR data can still be used to flag records for exclusion pending verification
#' by chart review in cases where EMR codes for kidney cancer or secondary 
#' tumors precede `r fs('a_tdiag')` or `r fs('a_trecur')` respectively. [This 
#' can also apply to nephrectomy EMR codes and `r fs('a_tsurg')` but I will need 
#' to distinguish between the prior nephrectomy being due to cancer versus other 
#' indications.]`r n2s(4.0)`
#' 
#' For now I am analyzing the data as if I only have access to NAACCR except
#' mortality where I do it both with ( [@fig:naaccrdeath_survfit] ) and 
#' without ( [@fig:alldeath_survfit] ) the EMR.

                          intersect(pat_samples$train

#' The point of this section is **solely** to test whether my scripts succeeded 
#' in turning the raw data elements into a time-to-event (TTE) variables to 
#' which Kaplan-Meier curves can be fit without numeric errors or grossly 
#' implausible results. All the plots below are from a small random sample of 
#' the data-- N=`r sum(.testsamp[1:2])`, `r .testsamp['Hispanic']` Hispanic and 
#' `r .testsamp['non-Hispanic white']` non-Hispanic white, 
#' `r .testsamp['Unknown']` unknown excluded. This is further reduced in some
#' cases as described in the figure captions. These sample sizes are not 
#' sufficient  to detect clinically significant differences and, again, **this 
#' is not the goal yet**. The intent is only to insure that my software 
#' performs correctly while keeping myself blinded to the hold-out data on 
#' which the hypothesis testing will ultimately be done.
#' 
#' Furthermore, these survival curves are not yet adjusted for covariates such 
#' as age or stage at diagnosis. There are also refinements planned to the
#'  exclusion criteria which I discuss below in [@sec:nextsteps].

#' 
#' Typically 2-4 weeks elapse diagnosis from surgery and providers try to 
#' not exceed 4 weeks. Nevertheless years may sometimes elapse due to factors 
#' such as an indolent tumors or loss of contact with the patient. About 15% of 
#' patients never undergo surgery [@pcRodriguez2018]. [@Fig:surg_survfit] is in
#' agreement with this. It can also be seen in [@fig:surg_survfit] that 
#' `r sum(with(.survfit_plot0$fit,n.event[time==0]))` surgeries seem to happen 
#' on the day of diagnosis. This is plausible if NAACCR diagnosis is based on 
#' pathology rather than clinical examination where a positive result is usually 
#' coded as a renal mass, not a cancer. [In my next data update I intend to 
#' also include all ICD9/10 codes for renal mass at which point I will revisit

# conclusions ---------------------------------------------------------
#' # Conclusion and next steps {#sec:nextsteps}
#' 
#' This detailed investigation of the available data elements and development 
#' of analysis scripts opens four priority directions: more data, 
#' _external_ data, more covariates, and improved pre-processing at the i2b2 
#' end (Aim 1).
#' 
#' More data can be acquired by reclaiming values that are currently
#' inconsistent or missing. There are various ad-hoc consistency checks 
#' described in [-@sec:xchecks; -@sec:diag; -@sec:surg]
#' [I need to gather these checks in one place and 
#' systematically run them on every patient to get a total count of records that
#' need manual chart review (Dr. Rodriguez's protocol) and for each record a 
#' list of issues to resolve]`r n2s(21)`. 
#' 
#' To reclaim missing values I will need to solve the problem of lag and 
#' disagreement between the EMR and NAACCR ([@sec:merging]). [I will meet with 
#' the MCC NAACCR registrar and learn where exactly in the EMR and other sources 
#' she looks to abstract 
#' `r fs(v(c_main_naaccr_vars),retfun=knitr::combine_words)`. I will also meet 
#' with personnel experienced in Urology chart review to learn their 
#' methods.]`r n2s(4.1)`. This may lead to  improvements in the CIRD ETL 
#' process. I also plan on adding all ICD codes for 'renal mass' 
#' [@pcRodriguez2018] to my i2b2 query ([-@sec:diag]). Meanwhile, in response to
#' researcher questions including my own, CIRD staff have identified thousands 
#' of NAACCR entries and surgery billing records that got excluded from i2b2 
#' because they are not associated with visits to UT Health clinics. After the 
#' next i2b2 refresh we expect an increased number of patients and possible 
#' improved agreement of event dates between EMR and NAACCR.
#' 
#' [For external data I will request non-aggregated limited/deidentified records 
#' from the Texas Cancer Registry. I will also look at the NCDB dataset obtained 
#' by Urology]`r n2s('69')` to see if it has the 
#' elements listed in [@sec:reqelmnts].
#' 
#' In the remainder of Aim 2 and Aim 3 I will need the following additional
#' variables: (NAACCR only) stage and grade; (EMR only) analgesics, smoking and
#' alcohol, family history of cancer or diabetes, lab results, vital signs,
#' Miperamine (as per Dr. Michalek), frequency of lab and image orders,
#' frequency and duration of visits, and participation in adjuvant trials;
#' (both) birthplace, language, and diabetes; and (census data in i2b2) income
#' and education. [Each of these will require a workup similar to that reported
#' in [@sec:dataprep] and [-@sec:supp]. I can work independently on many of these 
#' but I will need guidance from experts in Urology on interpreting the stage 
#' and grade data.]`r n2s(10)` If genomic data from 
#' the Urology biorepository becomes available for these patients in the course 
#' of this study it also will become an important variable for Aim 2.
#' 
#' The use of TCR or NCDB data is *not* a substitute for UT Health and MGH i2b2
#' data. The registries allow me to test the replicability of high-level
#' findings to State and National populations but they will not have the
#' detailed additional variables I will need to investigate the causes of
#' disparate patient outcomes.
#' 
#' Nor are the R scripts I wrote for this project a substitute for DataFinisher
#' [@bokov_denormalize_2016] development planned for Aim 1. On the contrary, the
#'  reason I was able to make this much progress
#' in one month is that the data linkage and de-identification was done by the 
#' CIRD i2b2 ETL, the data selection was simplified by the i2b2 web client, and
#' an enormous amount of post-processing was done by my DataFinisher app that
#' is integrated into our local i2b2. During the work I present here I found
#' several additional post-processing steps that generalize to other studies
#' and [I will integrate those into DataFinisher so that the data it outputs is
#' even more analysis-ready.]`r n2s('58')` This will, in 
#' turn, will simplify the logistics of Aim 3. 
#' 
#' [While I am incorporating the new methods into DataFinisher, I will also 
#' reorganize and document the code so I can present it to Dr. Murphy and his 
#' informatics team for review and input.]`r n2s(59)`

#  event indicators -------------------------------------------------------------
#' ## Which EMR and NAACCR variables are reliable event indicators? {#sec:vartrn}
#' 
#' For each of the main event variables `r fs('a_tdiag')`, `r fs('a_tsurg')`,
#' `r fs('a_trecur')`, and `r fs('a_tdeath')` / `r fs('n_vtstat')` there were 
#' multiple candidate data elements in the raw data. If such a 
#' family of elements is in good agreement overall then individual missing 
#' dates can be filled in with the earliest non-missing dates from other data
#' elements in that family (except for mortality where the _latest_ non-missing
#' date would make more sense). But to do this I needed not only to establish
#' qualitative agreement as I did for demographic variables in [@sec:linkagever]
#' and [-@sec:xchecks] but also determine how often these dates lag or lead each
#' other and by how much. The plots in this section use the y-axis to represent
#' time for patient records arranged along the x-axis. They are arranged in an
#' order that varies from one plot to another, chosen for visual 
#' interpretability. Each vertical slice of a plot represents one patient's 
#' history, with different colors representing events as documented by different
#' data elements. The goal is to see the frequency, magnitude, and direction of
#' divergence for several variables at the same time.
#' 
#  diagnosis ====================================================================
#' ### Initial diagnosis {#sec:diag}
#' 
#' At this time only `r fs('n_ddiag')` is usable for calculating 
#' `r fs('a_tdiag')`. Initially `r fs('n_fc')` was considered as an additional
#' NAACCR source along with the earliest EMR records of `r fs('e_kc_i9')` and 
#' `r fs('e_kc_i10')`. 
#' [`0443 Date Conclusive DX`](http://datadictionary.naaccr.org/default.aspx?c=10#443) 
#' is never used by our NAACCR. All other NAACCR data elements containing the 
#' word 'date' seem to be retired or related to events after initial diagnosis.
#' `r fs('n_fc')` was disqualified because it never precedes `r fs('n_ddiag')` 
#' but often trails behind `r fs('n_dsurg')`, see [@fig:diag2lc_eventplot]. 
#' [I will need to consult with a NAACCR registrar about what `r fs('n_fc')` 
#' actually means]`r n2s(4.2)` but it does not appear to be a first visit nor 
#' first diagnosis. As can be seen in [@fig:diag_plot] and [@tbl:diag_lag], the 
#' first ICD9 or ICD10 code most often occurs after initial diagnosis, sometimes
#' before the date of diagnosis, and coinciding with the date of diagnosis 
#' rarest of all. Several of the ICD9/10 first observed dates lead or trail the 
#' `r fs('n_ddiag')` by multiple years.

#' `r fs('n_ddiag')` by more than 3 months. An additional `r .eplot_diag_summ[2]`
#' patients have first EMR diagnoses that precede `r fs('n_ddiag')` by less than
#' three months. **These might need to be eliminated from the sample on the 
#' grounds of not being first occurrences of kidney cancer.** However, we cannot

#' because there is too frequently disagreement between the the two sources, and 
#' the EMR records are currently biased toward later dates.

#' ### Surgery {#sec:surg}

#  hispanic ethnicity ===========================================================
#' ### Whether or not the patient is Hispanic {#sec:hispanic}
#' 
#' Despite the overall agreement between `r fs('n_hisp')` and `r fs('e_hisp')`
#' there needs to be some way to adjudicate the minority of cases where the 
#' sources disagree. The following additional data elements can provide 
#' relevant information to form a final consensus variable for analysis: 
#' `r fs(c('language_cd','e_lng','e_eth','race_cd','a_n_race'),retfun=knitr::combine_words)`
#' First, each of these variables is re-coded to `Hispanic`, `non-Hispanic`, and
#' `Unknown`.
#' 
#' `r fs('language_cd')` and `r fs('e_lng')` are interpreted as being evidence
#' in favor of `Hispanic` ethnicity if the language includes Spanish. English,
#' ASL, and unknown values are all treated as `Unknown` ethnicity.
#' However, a language _other_ than the above (e.g. German) is interpreted as
#' evidence for being `non-Hispanic`.
#' 
#' `r fs('n_hisp')` already have explicit designations of `non-Hispanic` and 
#' `Unknown` and all other values are interpreted as `Hispanic`. 
#' `r fs('e_hisp')` is interpreted as `Hispanic` if `TRUE` and `Unknown` if 
#' `FALSE` (in contrast with most of the other elements, there is no way to
#' distinguish a genuinely `FALSE` value of `r fs('e_hisp')` from a missing one).
#' 
#' `r fs('e_eth')` is the whole ethnicity variable from i2b2 OBSERVATION_FACT 
#' and suprprisingly it sometimes disagrees with `r fs('e_hisp')`. A value of
#' `hispanic` is interpreted directly. The values `other`,`unknown`,
#' `unknown/othe`,`i choose not`, and `@` are all interpeted as `Unknown` and 
#' any other value (at our site, `arab-amer` and `non-hispanic`) is interpreted
#' as `non-Hispanic`. Rules are then applied to create unified variables from 
#' all these data elements. I have three such variables-- 
#' `r knitr::combine_words(fs(c('a_hsp_naaccr','a_hsp_broad','a_hsp_strict')))`
#' 
#' `r fs('a_hsp_naaccr')` only uses information from NAACCR. 
#' 
#' `r fs('a_hsp_broad')` errs on
#' the side of assigning `Hispanic` ethnicity if there is any evidence for it at
#' all, then `non-Hispanic`, and `Unknown` only if there is truly no information
#' from any source about the patient's ethnicity. In particular, `Hispanic` is 
#' assigned if _any_ non-missing values of 
#' `r knitr::combine_words(fs(c('language_cd','e_lng','n_hisp','e_hisp','e_eth')))` 
#' have a value of `Hispanic`; `Unknown` if _all_ non-missing values of 
#' `r knitr::combine_words(fs(c('language_cd','e_lng','n_hisp','e_hisp','e_eth')))` 
#' are unanimous for `Unknown` ; and `non-Hispanic` otherwise.
#' 
#' Finally, 
#' `r fs('a_hsp_strict')` only assigns `Hispanic` if _all_ non-missing values of 
#' `r fs('n_hisp')`, `r fs('e_hisp')`, and `r fs('e_eth')` are unanimous for
#' `Hispanic`. `non-Hispanic` is assigned if _all_ non-missing values of
#' `r fs('n_hisp')` and `r fs('e_eth')` are unanimous for `non-Hispanic` (the 
#' `r fs('e_hisp')` element is not used for the reasons explained 
#' above) _and_ neither `r fs('e_lng')` nor `r fs('language_cd')` vote for
#' `Hispanic`. If neither of these conditions are met, `Unknown` is assigned.
#' 
#' There is an additional step for patients coded as `non-Hispanic` where they 
#' are further classified into `non-Hispanic white` and `Other`. For 
#' `r fs('a_hsp_naaccr')` this is determined by whether or `r fs('a_n_race')` is
#' `White`. For `r fs('a_hsp_broad')` the criterion is whether _at least one_ of
#' `r fs('a_n_race')` or `r fs('race_cd')` is `White`. For 
#' `r fs('a_hsp_strict')` it's whether _both_ `r fs('a_n_race')` and 
#' `r fs('race_cd')` are `White`.
#' 
#' In the end, 
#' `r fs(c('a_hsp_naaccr','a_hsp_broad','a_hsp_strict'),retfun=knitr::combine_words)`
#' all have the same levels, but differ in the proportion of patients assigned 
#' to each.

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach to specific object detection in complex scenes using color-based entropy features and a fuzzy classifier (FC). Appearances of the detected objects are assumed to contain multiple colors in non-homogeneous distributions that make it difficult to detect these objects using shape features. The proposed detection approach consists of two filtering phases with two different novel color-based entropy features. The first phase filters a test pattern with the entropy of color component (ECC). A self-splitting clustering (SSC) algorithm is proposed to automatically generate clusters in the hue and saturation (HS) color space according to the composing pixels of an object. The ECC value is computed from histograms of pixels in the found clusters and is used to generate object candidates. The second filtering phase uses the entropies of geometric color distributions (EGCD) to filter the object candidates obtained from the first phase. An EGCD is computed for each of the clustered composing colors of a candidate object. The EGCD values are fed to an FC to enable advanced filtering. A new FC using the SSC algorithm and support vector machine (FC-SSCSVM) for antecedent and consequent parameter learning, respectively, is proposed to improve detection performance. Experimental results on the detection of different objects and comparisons with various detection approaches and classifiers verify the advantage of the proposed detection approach using the FC-SSCSVM.},

Privacy concerns may prevent the parties from directly sharing the data and some types of information about the data.

The objective of this paper is to provide solutions for privacy-preserving collaborative data mining problems. In particular, we illustrate how to conduct privacy-preserving naive Bayesian classification which is one of the data mining tasks. To measure the privacy level for privacy- preserving schemes, we propose a definition of privacy and show that our solutions preserve data privacy.},

  abstract = {Biology is in the middle of a data explosion. The technical advances achieved by the genomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics and proteomics technologies in recent years have significantly increased the amount of data that are available for biologists to analyze different aspects of an organism. However, *omics data sets have several additional problems: they have inherent biological complexity and may have significant amounts of noise as well as measurement artifacts. The need to extract information from such databases has once again become a challenge. This requires novel computational techniques and models to automatically perform data mining tasks such as integration of different data types, clustering and knowledge discovery, among others. In this article, we will present a novel integrated computational intelligence approach for biological data mining that involves neural networks and evolutionary computation. We propose the use of self-organizing maps for the identification of coordinated patterns variations; a new training algorithm that can include a priori biological information to obtain more biological meaningful clusters; a validation measure that can assess the biological significance of the clusters found; and finally, an evolutionary algorithm for the inference of unknown metabolic pathways involving the selected clusters.},

In this paper, we study this problem in the online conversation context and investigate how to automatically retrieve the most context-relevant previously-seen web information without user intervention. We propose a Context-aware Personal Information Retrieval (CPIR) algorithm, which considers both the participatory and implicit-topical properties of the context to improve the retrieval performance. Since both the context and the user's web information are usually short and ambiguous, the participatory context is utilized to formulate and expand the query. Moreover, the implicit-topical context is exploited to implicitly determine the importance of each web information of the targeting user in the given context. The experimental results using real-world dataset demonstrate that CPIR can achieve significant improvements over several baselines.},

  abstract = {Since the industrial revolution, technological evolution has been the defining aspect of societal progress. Among all the technologies that have emerged over the years, information technology is the one that truly revolutionized the modern lifestyle. To take information technology beyond information mining and communication, intelligence technology (InT) is required to manipulate the information and knowledge with human-like intelligence. However, transforming InT into the next technological wave requires a medium to actualize InT with all its potential. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an intelligence super agent (iSA) as an autonomous entity equipped with all categories of intelligence, i.e. cognitive, social, behavioral, ambient, collective, and genetic intelligences. To realize the iSA, we also present a modular architecture, named intelligence operating architecture (iOA), capable of implementing all aspects of InT along with a biologically-inspired thought process. As a novel implementation platform for the iSA, we present user-centered development of robots enacted through agent based modularization (UDREAM). The effectiveness of UDREAM is shown through some application-specific experiments with individual robots. Although the current iSA is for a limited number of services with a standalone robot, it can be extended to a more complex iSA.},

The challenges of the enormous, dynamic, incredibly diverse and high complexity of the IoT urgently require novel self-organization scheme because most of the existing distributed self-organization schemes cannot be directly applied to it. In this paper, we propose an intelligent self-organizing scheme (ISOS) for the IoT inspired by the endocrine regulating mechanism. For each node in the network, an autonomous area is established, where the node can effectively interact with its peers and perform self-control according to its own status and dynamic circumstance in a decentralized infrastructure. By introducing the hormone mechanism as the medium for information transmission and data sharing, the nodes can collaborate with each other and work in a cooperative way. Through adjusting the release procedure of the hormones, the ability to effectively detect service randomly generated can also be guaranteed in the probabilistic partially-working IoT. Simulation results verify the performance of the proposed mechanism that entitles the IoT to the ability of maintaining its status in a globally stable status, while effectively discovering the random service requests in a resource-critical configuration. The ISOS would be of great significance for the practical implementation of the IoT.},

For example, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will begin operations in northern Chile in 2022, will generate a nearly 150 Petabyte imaging dataset of the southern hemisphere sky. The LSST will stream data at rates of 2 Terabytes per hour, effectively capturing an unprecedented movie of the sky. The LSST is expected not only to improve our understanding of time-varying astrophysical objects, but also to reveal a plethora of yet unknown faint and fast-varying phenomena. To cope with a change of paradigm to data-driven astronomy, the fields of astroinformatics and astrostatistics have been created recently. The new data-oriented paradigms for astronomy combine statistics, data mining, knowledge discovery, machine learning and computational intelligence, in order to provide the automated and robust methods needed for the rapid detection and classification of known astrophysical objects as well as the unsupervised characterization of novel phenomena. In this article we present an overview of machine learning and computational intelligence applications to TDA. Future big data challenges and new lines of research in TDA, focusing on the LSST, are identified and discussed from the viewpoint of computational intelligence/machine learning.

  abstract = {The world continues to generate quintillion bytes of data daily, leading to the pressing needs for new efforts in dealing with the grand challenges brought by Big Data. Today, there is a growing consensus among the computational intelligence communities that data volume presents an immediate challenge pertaining to the scalability issue. However, when addressing volume in Big Data analytics, researchers in the data analytics community have largely taken a one-sided study of volume, which is the "Big Instance Size" factor of the data. The flip side of volume which is the dimensionality factor of Big Data, on the other hand, has received much lesser attention. This article thus represents an attempt to fill in this gap and places special focus on this relatively under-explored topic of "Big Dimensionality", wherein the explosion of features (variables) brings about new challenges to computational intelligence. We begin with an analysis on the origins of Big Dimensionality. The evolution of feature dimensionality in the last two decades is then studied using popular data repositories considered in the data analytics and computational intelligence research communities. Subsequently, the state-of-the-art feature selection schemes reported in the field of computational intelligence are reviewed to reveal the inadequacies of existing approaches in keeping pace with the emerging phenomenon of Big Dimensionality. Last but not least, the "curse and blessing of Big Dimensionality" are delineated and deliberated.},

  abstract = {Time series prediction techniques have been used in many real-world applications such as financial market prediction, electric utility load forecasting , weather and environmental state prediction, and reliability forecasting. The underlying system models and time series data generating processes are generally complex for these applications and the models for these systems are usually not known a priori. Accurate and unbiased estimation of the time series data produced by these systems cannot always be achieved using well known linear techniques, and thus the estimation process requires more advanced time series prediction algorithms. This paper provides a survey of time series prediction applications using a novel machine learning approach: support vector machines (SVM). The underlying motivation for using SVMs is the ability of this methodology to accurately forecast time series data when the underlying system processes are typically nonlinear, non-stationary and not defined a-priori. SVMs have also been proven to outperform other non-linear techniques including neural-network based non-linear prediction techniques such as multi-layer perceptrons.The ultimate goal is to provide the reader with insight into the applications using SVM for time series prediction, to give a brief tutorial on SVMs for time series prediction, to outline some of the advantages and challenges in using SVMs for time series prediction, and to provide a source for the reader to locate books, technical journals, and other online SVM research resources.},

Such patterns are critical in phenotyping patients using their medical records in research and quality improvement. We have previously developed the Analytic Information Warehouse (AIW), which computes such phenotypes using temporal abstraction but requires software engineers to use. We have extended the AIW's web user interface, Eureka! Clinical Analytics, to support specifying phenotypes using an alternative model that we developed with clinical stakeholders. The software converts phenotypes from this model to that of temporal abstraction prior to data processing. The model can represent all phenotypes in a quality improvement project and a growing set of phenotypes in a multi-site research study.

To illustrate its function through an example focused on the development of a tool for diagnosing pneumonia. Materials and methods We developed a system that automates the creation of diagnostic decision-support applications. It relies on a medical ontology to direct the acquisition of clinic data from a clinical data warehouse and uses an automated analytic system to apply a sequence of machine learning algorithms that create applications for diagnostic screening. We refer to this system as the ontology-driven diagnostic modeling system (ODMS). We tested this system using samples of patient data collected in Salt Lake City emergency rooms and stored in Intermountain Healthcare's enterprise data warehouse. Results The system was used in the preliminary development steps of a tool to identify patients with pneumonia in the emergency department. This tool was compared with a manually created diagnostic tool derived from a curated dataset. The manually created tool is currently in clinical use. The automatically created tool had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.920 (95\% CI 0.916 to 0.924), compared with 0.944 (95\% CI 0.942 to 0.947) for the manually created tool. Discussion Initial testing of the ODMS demonstrates promising accuracy for the highly automated results and illustrates the route to model improvement. Conclusions The use of medical knowledge, embedded in ontologies, to direct the initial development of diagnostic computing systems appears feasible.},

  abstract = {Big data has the potential to create significant value in health care by improving outcomes while lowering costs. Big data's defining features include the ability to handle massive data volume and variety at high velocity. New, flexible, and easily expandable information technology (IT) infrastructure, including so-called data lakes and cloud data storage and management solutions, make big-data analytics possible. However, most health IT systems still rely on data warehouse structures. Without the right IT infrastructure, analytic tools, visualization approaches, work flows, and interfaces, the insights provided by big data are likely to be limited. Big data's success in creating value in the health care sector may require changes in current polices to balance the potential societal benefits of big-data approaches and the protection of patients' confidentiality. Other policy implications of using big data are that many current practices and policies related to data use, access, sharing, privacy, and stewardship need to be revised.},

To examine the strengths and limitations of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW) algorithm for identifying chronic conditions in older persons from Medicare beneficiary data.

We estimated the percent of preexisting cases of chronic conditions correctly identified by the CCW algorithm during its reference period and the number of years of claims data necessary to find a preexisting condition. Principal Findings. The CCW algorithm identified 69 percent of preexisting diabetes cases but only 17 percent of preexisting arthritis cases. Cases identified by the CCW are a mix of preexisting and newly diagnosed conditions. Conclusions. The prevalence of conditions needing less frequent health care utilization (e.g., arthritis) may be underestimated by the CCW algorithm. The CCW reference periods may not be sufficient for all analytic purposes.},

Data Sources: The 2004 Chronic Condition Data Warehouse, including the Medicare 5\% standard analytic file and OASIS. Study participants were 66,5 10 Medicare beneficiaries with a home health start of care assessment between January 15, 2004 and July 15. 2004 who were discharged before December 1, 2004. Results: Home health patients frequently incurred acute and post-acute services during the 14 days preceding admission and the 30 days after discharge, predominantly in acute hospitals. Substantial differences were observed in beneficiaries' health and functioning, across livin,, arrangements; patients living alone were less medically complex, less disabled, and received less assistance than those living with others. Agreement between OASIS and administrative claims was uniformly low with regard to inpatient hospital, inpatient rehabilitation, and skilled nursing facility use in the 14 days preceding the home health start of care. Agreement between OASIS and administrative claims was uneven for the period after discharge from home health care; it was determined to be near perfect for inpatient hospital (kappa = 0.85) but was lower for inpatient rehabilitation and hospice (kappa = 0.22 and 0.10. respectively). Conclusions: Findings reinforce the potential merit of patient-specific rather than setting-specific measures of quality. but underscore practical challenges to constructing measures that span data sources and episodes of care.},

  abstract = {Objective: To create an analytics platform for specifying and detecting clinical phenotypes and other derived variables in electronic health record (EHR) data for quality improvement investigations. Materials and methods: We have developed an architecture for an Analytic Information Warehouse (AIW). It supports transforming data represented in different physical schemas into a common data model, specifying derived variables in terms of the common model to enable their reuse, computing derived variables while enforcing invariants and ensuring correctness and consistency of data transformations, long-term curation of derived data, and export of derived data into standard analysis tools. It includes software that implements these features and a computing environment that enables secure high-performance access to and processing of large datasets extracted from EHRs. Results: We have implemented and deployed the architecture in production locally. The software is available as open source. We have used it as part of hospital operations in a project to reduce rates of hospital readmission within 30 days. The project examined the association of over 100 derived variables representing disease and co-morbidity phenotypes with readmissions in 5 years of data from our institution's clinical data warehouse and the UHC Clinical Database (CDB). The CDB contains administrative data from over 200 hospitals that are in academic medical centers or affiliated with such centers. Discussion and conclusion: A widely available platform for managing and detecting phenotypes in EHR data could accelerate the use of such data in quality improvement and comparative effectiveness studies.

  title = {Introduction},
  volume = {17},
  issn = {1083-4087},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act brought considerable attention to comparative effectiveness research (CER). OBJECTIVES: To (a) suggest best practices for conducting and reporting CER using "real-world data" (RWD), (b) describe some of the data and infrastructure requirements for conducting CER using RWD, (c) identify statistical challenges with the analysis of nonrandomized studies and suggest appropriate techniques to address those challenges, (d) recognize the value of patient-reported outcomes in CER, (e) encourage the incorporation of observational data into randomized controlled studies, and (f) highlight the importance of incorporating payers in industry-sponsored research. SUMMARY: The first article in this supplement, "Something old, something new ..." provides a policy perspective on the recent evolution of CER. It reviews the historical context, discusses the "promise and fear" of CER, and then describes the new role of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) in defining and sponsoring CER. The second paper, "Ten Commandments," proposes a series of tenets for planning, conducting, and reporting CER done with RWD. Oriented for basic-to-intermediate researchers, it combines standard scientific research principles with considerations specific to nonrandomized, RWD studies. The third article, "Infrastructure Requirements," points out that effective use of secondary data requires addressing major methodological and infrastructural issues, including development of analytical tools to readily access and analyze data, formulation of guidelines to enhance quality and transparency, establishment of data standards, and creation of data warehouses that respect the privacy and confidentiality of patients. It identifies gaps that must be filled to address the underlying issues, with emphasis on data standards, data quality assurance, data warehouses, computing environment, and protection of privacy and confidentiality. The fourth paper, "Statistical Issues," discusses how the validity of analytic results from observational studies is adversely impacted by biases that may be introduced due to lack of randomization. It reviews some of the methodological challenges that arise in the analysis of data from nonrandomized studies, with particular emphasis on the limitations of traditional approaches and potential solutions from recent methodological developments. The fifth paper, "Considerations on the Use of Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs)," describes how PRO data can play a critical role in guiding patients, health care providers, payers, and policy makers in making informed decisions regarding patient-centered treatment from among alternative options and technologies and have been noted as such by PCORI. However, collection and interpretation of such data within the context of CER have not yet been fully established. It discusses some challenges with including PROs in CER initiatives, provides a framework for their effective use, and proposes several areas for future research. Lastly, "Developing a Collaborative Study Protocol ..." indicates that there is the potential, the desire, and the capability for payers to be involved in CER studies, combining elements of their own observational data with prospective studies. It describes a case example of a payer, a pharmaceutical company, and a research organization collaborating on a prospective study to examine the effect of prior authorization for pregabalin on health care costs to the payer. CONCLUSION: Researchers at Pfizer routinely conduct CER-type studies. In this supplement, we have proposed some approaches that we believe are useful in developing certain kinds of evidence and have described some of our experiences. Our experiences also make us acutely aware of the limitations of approaches and data sources that have been used for CER studies and suggest that there is a need to further develop methods that are most useful for answering CER questions.

  abstract = {Background: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has implemented the CMS-Hierarchical Condition Category (CMS-HCC) model to risk adjust Medicare capitation payments. This study intends to assess the performance of the CMS-HCC risk adjustment method and to compare it to the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidity measures in predicting in-hospital and six-month mortality in Medicare beneficiaries. Methods: The study used the 2005-2006 Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW) 5\% Medicare files. The primary study sample included all community-dwelling fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries with a hospital admission between January 1(st), 2006 and June 30(th), 2006. Additionally, four disease-specific samples consisting of subgroups of patients with principal diagnoses of congestive heart failure (CHF), stroke, diabetes mellitus (DM), and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were also selected. Four analytic files were generated for each sample by extracting inpatient and/or outpatient claims for each patient. Logistic regressions were used to compare the methods. Model performance was assessed using the c-statistic, the Akaike's information criterion (AIC), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and their 95\% confidence intervals estimated using bootstrapping. Results: The CMS-HCC had statistically significant higher c-statistic and lower AIC and BIC values than the Charlson and Elixhauser methods in predicting in-hospital and six-month mortality across all samples in analytic files that included claims from the index hospitalization. Exclusion of claims for the index hospitalization generally led to drops in model performance across all methods with the highest drops for the CMS-HCC method. However, the CMS-HCC still performed as well or better than the other two methods. Conclusions: The CMS-HCC method demonstrated better performance relative to the Charlson and Elixhauser methods in predicting in-hospital and six-month mortality. The CMS-HCC model is preferred over the Charlson and Elixhauser methods if information about the patient's diagnoses prior to the index hospitalization is available and used to code the risk adjusters. However, caution should be exercised in studies evaluating inpatient processes of care and where data on pre-index admission diagnoses are unavailable.},

Prior studies have validated the Natural Language Processing (NLP) program, Leximer for classifying unstructured radiology reports based on the presence of positive radiology findings (F (POS)) and negative radiology findings (F (NEG)). The F (POS) included new relevant radiology findings and any change in status from prior imaging. Electronic radiology reports from 1995-2002 and data from analysis of these reports with NLP-Leximer were saved in a data warehouse and exported to a multidimensional structure called the Radcube. Various relational queries on the data in the Radcube were performed using OLAP technique. Thus, NLP-OLAP was applied to determine trends of F (POS) in different radiology exams for different patient and examination attributes. Pivot tables were exported from NLP-OLAP interface to Microsoft Excel for statistical analysis. Radcube allowed rapid and comprehensive analysis of F (POS) and F (NEG) trends in a large radiology report database. Trends of F (POS) were extracted for different patient attributes such as age groups, gender, clinical indications, diseases with ICD codes, patient types (inpatient, ambulatory), imaging characteristics such as imaging modalities, referring physicians, radiology subspecialties, and body regions. Data analysis showed substantial differences between F (POS) rates for different imaging modalities ranging from 23.1\% (mammography, 49,163/212,906) to 85.8\% (nuclear medicine, 93,852/109,374; p $<$ 0.0001). In conclusion, NLP-OLAP can help in analysis of yield of different radiology exams from a large radiology report database.},

An extension to SQL is presented that enables the analyst to designate groups of rows. These groups can then be manipulated and aggregated in various ways to solve a number of useful analytic problems. The extended SQL is concise and runs in linear time, while standard SQL requires multiple statements with polynomial performance. The extensions are extremely powerful for performing aggregations on large amounts of data, which is useful in clinical data mining applications.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to test a cumulative view of current data in the clinical database at the Faculty of Dentistry, Dalhousie University. We planned to examine associations among demographic factors and treatments. METHODS: Three tables were selected from the database of the faculty: patient, treatment and procedures. All fields and record numbers in each table were documented. Data was explored using SQL server and Visual Basic and then cleaned by removing incongruent fields. After transformation, a data warehouse was created. This was imported to SQL analysis services manager to create an OLAP (Online Analytic Process) cube. RESULTS: The multidimensional model used for access to data was created using a star schema. Treatment count was the measurement variable. Five dimensions--date, postal code, gender, age group and treatment categories--were used to detect associations. Another data warehouse of 8 tables (international tooth code \# 1-8) was created and imported to SAS enterprise miner to complete data mining. Association nodes were used for each table to find sequential associations and minimum criteria were set to 2\% of cases. Findings of this study confirmed most assumptions of treatment planning procedures. There were some small unexpected patterns of clinical interest. Further developments are recommended to create predictive models. CONCLUSIONS: Recent improvements in information technology offer numerous advantages for conversion of raw data from faculty databases to information and subsequently to knowledge. This knowledge can be used by decision makers, managers, and researchers to answer clinical questions, affect policy change and determine future research needs.},

  abstract = {To remain competitive, enterprises are evolving in order to quickly respond to changing market conditions and customer needs. In this new environment, a single centralized data warehouse is no longer sufficient. Next generation business intelligence involves data flows that span multiple, diverse processing engines, that contain complex functionality like data/text analytics, machine learning operations, and that need to be optimized against various objectives. A common example is the use of Hadoop to analyze unstructured text and merging these results with relational database queries over the data warehouse. We refer to these multi-engine analytic data flows as hybrid flows. Currently, it is a cumbersome task to create and run hybrid flows. Custom scripts must be written to dispatch tasks to the individual processing engines and to exchange intermediate results. So, designing correct hybrid flows is a challenging task. Optimizing such flows is even harder. Additionally, when the underlying computing infrastructure changes, existing flows likely need modification and reoptimization. The current, ad-hoc design approach cannot scale as hybrid flows become more commonplace. To address this challenge, we are building a platform to design and manage hybrid flows. It supports the logical design of hybrid flows in which implementation details are not exposed. It generates code for the underlying processing engines and orchestrates their execution. But the key enabling technology in the platform is an optimizer that converts the logical flow to an executable form that is optimized for the underlying infrastructure according to user-specified objectives. In this paper, we describe challenges in designing the optimizer and our solutions. We illustrate the optimizer through a real-world use case. We present a logical design and optimized designs for the use case. We show how the performance of the use case varies depending on the system configuration and how the optimizer is able to generate different optimized flows for different configurations.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the use of the optimization procedures in SAS/OR software with application to the contemporary logistics distribution network design using an integrated multiple criteria decision making approach. Unlike the traditional optimization techniques, the proposed approach, combining analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and goal programming (GP), considers both quantitative and qualitative factors. In the integrated approach, AHP is used to determine the relative importance weightings or priorities of alternative warehouses with respect to both deliverer oriented and customer oriented criteria. Then, a GP model incorporating the constraints of system, resource, and AHP priority is formulated to select the best set of warehouses without exceeding the limited available resources. To facilitate the use of integrated multiple criteria decision making approach by SAS users, an ORMCDM code was implemented in the SAS programming language. The SAS macro developed in this paper selects the chosen variables from a SAS data file and constructs sets of linear programming models based on the selected GP model. An example is given to illustrate how one could use the code to design the logistics distribution network. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Materializing and incrementally maintaining a full data cube or even its compression or approximation over a data stream is often computationally prohibitive. On the other hand, although previous studies proposed approximate methods for continuous aggregate queries, they cannot provide accurate answers. In this paper, we develop a novel prefix aggregate tree (PAT) structure for online warehousing data streams and answering ad hoc aggregate queries. Often, a data stream can be partitioned into the historical segment, which is stored in a traditional data warehouse, and the transient segment, which can be stored in a PAT to answer ad hoc aggregate queries. The size of a PAT is linear in the size of the transient segment, and only one scan of the data stream is needed to create and incrementally maintain a PAT. Although the query answering using PAT costs more than the case of a fully materialized data cube, the query answering time is still kept linear in the size of the transient segment. Our extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets illustrate the efficiency and the scalability of our design.},

  abstract = {In multidimensional data models intended for online analytic processing (OLAP), data are viewed as points in a multidimensional space. Each dimension has structure, described by a directed graph of categories, a set of members for each category, and a child/parent relation between members. An important application of this structure is to use it to infer summarizability, that is, whether an aggregate view defined for some category can be correctly derived from a set of precomputed views defined for other categories. A dimension is called structurally heterogeneous if two members in a given category are allowed to have ancestors in different categories. In this article, we propose a class of integrity constraints, dimension constraints, that allow us to reason about summarizability in heterogeneous dimensions. We introduce the notion of frozen dimensions which are minimal homogeneous dimension instances representing the different structures that are implicitly combined in a heterogeneous dimension. Frozen dimensions provide the basis for efficiently testing the implication of dimension constraints and are a useful aid to understanding heterogeneous dimensions. We give a sound and complete algorithm for solving the implication of dimension constraints that uses heuristics based on the structure of the dimension and the constraints to speed up its execution. We study the intrinsic complexity of the implication problem and the running time of our algorithm.},

The context data is temporarily stored in the form of a multidimensional cube to perform OLAP operations. Three sets of operations are defined. The first converts the data in a stream to a context, the second allows altering the context and the third set is analytical which operates on the context and produces an output stream. More than one related analytic operation can be performed for the data in a context. The sequence of operations, referred to as context queries, is continuously executed for a time-based window.

In the conventional design process, system engineers utilize experimental and intuitional approaches.

We propose an analytic flow design algorithm using a dynamic network flow model and considering time-variable flow volumes according to shipment and storage schedules.

  abstract = {Purpose - This paper seeks to illustrate the successful development of a warehousing decision support system (WDSS) that aided the Buckeye Cable Vision Incorporated (BCV) in making its strategic warehouse expansion and re-warehousing decisions. The WDSS utilized by the BCV can be a blue-print for other companies which would like to improve their warehousing productivity and strengthen the warehousing link to their supply chain. Design/methodology/approach - Warehousing costs make up a significant portion of a company's business expenditures. Thus, many companies are pressured to control warehousing costs by improving their warehousing productivity. However, it is not an easy task to improve warehousing productivity given the increased complexity associated with today's warehousing activities such as value-added services and cross-docking operations. To cope with such warehousing challenges, a specific decision support system (DSS) that incorporates several computer-based models into the warehouse decision-making process is proposed. These models include: a simulation model based on computer-aided design, an analytic hierarchy process, and a forecasting technique. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed DSS and provide practical guidance for other companies that seek the DSS as a powerful decision-aid tool, this paper conducted an in-depth case analysis of the BCV that successfully exploited the WDSS. Findings - Through the BCV's case, it was shown that the WDSS could not only enhance warehousing productivity, but could also improve supply chain visibility. Also, it was found that the WDSS success lay in the company's ability to sustain high data quality by standardizing, cleaning, and updating relevant data on a real-time basis. Originality/value - Since the early 1970s, a DSS has attracted attention from both profit and non-profit organizations. Despite the long history of DSS evolution, it has been rarely applied to strategic warehousing decisions. This paper is one of the first attempts to develop a specific DSS that can assist warehousing managers in documenting warehousing costs, identifying non-value adding activities, evaluating strategic warehousing alternatives, and utilizing given warehousing resources.},

Therefore, this paper aims to develop an enhanced fuzzy neural network (EFNN) based decision support system for managing automobile spares inventory in a central warehouse. In this system, the EFNN is utilized for forecasting the demand for spare parts. However, without considering relevant domain knowledge, traditional neural networks are found to be suffered from the problem of low accuracy of forecasting unseen examples. Therefore, in our EFNN, the following improvement is made: First, it assigns connection weights based on the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method without painstakingly turning them. Second, by generating and refining activation functions according to genetic algorithm, our EFNN can provide comprehensive and accurate activation functions and fit a wider range of nonlinear models. Last, but not least, an adaptive input variable is introduced to decrease the impact of the bullwhip effect on the forecasting accuracy. The proposed system is evaluated with the real word data and experimental results indicate that our EFNN outperforms other five models in fill rate and stock cost measures. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To explore the role of data warehousing in surveillance systems, we study naturally occurring incidents, Florida wildfires from 1996 through 2001, as reasonable facsimiles of bioterrorism attacks. Hospital admissions data on respiratory illnesses during that period are analyzed to uncover patterns that might resemble an airborne biochemical attack. A principal contribution of this research is the adroit use of online analytic processing (OLAP) techniques, along with spatial and statistical analyses, to study the adverse effects of this natural phenomenon. These techniques will provide important capabilities for epidemiologist-in-the-loop surveillance systems, enabling the rapid exploration of unusual situations and guidance for follow-up investigations.

  abstract = {A data cube provides aggregate information to support a class of queries such as a range-sum query. To process those queries efficiently, some auxiliary information, i.e. prefix sums, is pre-computed and maintained. In reality however most of high dimensional data cubes are very sparse, causing a serious space overhead. In this paper, we investigate an algorithm that extracts dense sub-cubes from a large sparse cube based on the density function. Instead of maintaining a large prefix-sum cube, a few dense sub-cubes are maintained to reduce the space overhead and to restrict the update propagation. We present an iterative method that identifies dense intervals in each dimension and constructs sub-cubes based on the intervals found. We show the effectiveness of our method through the analytic comparison and experiment with respect to various data sets and dimensions.},

In this article, we present a general data warehouse/online analytic processing (OLAP) framework for web usage mining and business intelligence reporting. When we integrate the web data warehouse construction, data mining, and OLAP into the e-commerce system, this tight integration dramatically reduces the time and effort for web usage mining, business intelligence reporting, and mining deployment. Our data warehouse/OLAP framework consists of four phases: data capture, webhouse construction (clickstream marts), pattern discovery and cube construction, and pattern evaluation and deployment. We discuss data transformation operations for web usage mining and business reporting in clickstream, session, and customer levels; describe the problems and challenging issues in each phase in detail; provide plausible solutions to the issues; and demonstrate the framework with some examples from some real web sites. Our data warehouse/ OLAP framework has been integrated into some commercial e-commerce systems. We believe this data warehouse/OLAP framework would be very useful for developing any real-world web usage mining and business intelligence reporting systems. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Several countries with generalized, high-prevalence HIV epidemics, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, have experienced rapid declines in transmission. These HIV epidemics, often with rapid onsets, have generally been attributed to a combination of factors related to high-risk sexual behavior. The subsequent declines in these countries began prior to widespread therapy or implementation of any other major biomedical prevention. This change has been construed as evidence of behavior change, often on the basis of mathematical models, but direct evidence for behavior changes that would explain these declines is limited. Here, we look at the structure of current models and argue that the common ``fixed risk per sexual contact" assumption favors the conclusion of substantial behavior changes. We argue that this assumption ignores reported non-linearities between exposure and risk. Taking this into account, we propose that some of the decline in HIV transmission may be part of the natural dynamics of the epidemic, and that several factors that have traditionally been ignored by modelers for lack of precise quantitative estimates may well hold the key to understanding epidemiologic trends.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whereas sexual relationships among low-risk individuals account for the majority of HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa, limited knowledge exists about the structure and characteristics of sexual networks among the general population in sub-Saharan Africa.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the population-level structure of sexual networks connecting the young adult population of several villages on Likoma Island (Malawi), and analyse the structural position of HIV-positive individuals within the sexual network.
DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional sociocentric survey of sexual partnerships and biomarkers of prevalent HIV infections.
RESULTS: The study documents the existence of a large and robust sexual network linking a substantial fraction of the island's young adult population: half of all sexually active respondents were connected in a giant network component, and more than a quarter were linked through multiple independent chains of sexual relationships. This high network connectivity emerges within short time frames. The prevalence of HIV also varied significantly across the network, with sparser regions having a higher HIV prevalence than densely connected components. Several risk factors related to sexual mixing patterns help explain differentials in HIV prevalence across network locations.
CONCLUSION: Contrary to claims that sexual networks in rural sub-Saharan Africa are too sparse to sustain generalized HIV epidemics, the structure of the networks observed in Likoma appears compatible with a broad diffusion of HIV among lower-risk groups. The non-homogeneous distribution of HIV infection within the network suggests that network characteristics are an important determinant of the dynamics of HIV spread within a population.},

These data might hold the keys to developing appropriate strategies for mimicking the effective responses of those who appear immune. In this paper we review genetic mechanisms including the role of chemokines and their receptors, cytokines, host genetic immune response to HIV infection, local immune response correlating with behavioral variables, co-infection and immune based mechanisms that have been elucidated so far.

However, why HIV-1M has caused a devastating pandemic while the other groups remain contained is unclear. Interestingly, only HIV-1M Vpu, a viral protein, can robustly counteract human tetherin, which tethers budding virions. Therefore, we hypothesize that this property of HIV-1M Vpu facilitates human-to-human viral transmission. Adopting a multilayered experimental-mathematical approach, we demonstrate that HIV-1M Vpu confers a 2.38-fold increase in the prevalence of HIV-1 transmission. When Vpu activity is lost, protected human populations emerge (i.e., intrinsic herd immunity develops) through the anti-viral effect of tetherin. We also reveal that all Vpus of transmitted/founder HIV-1M viruses maintain anti-tetherin activity. These findings indicate that tetherin plays the role of a host restriction factor, providing `intrinsic herd immunity', whereas Vpu has evolved in HIV-1M as a tetherin antagonist.},

The peptide repertoire of a specific molecule is to a large extent determined by the molecular structure accommodating so-called main anchor positions of the presented peptide. These receptors are extremely polymorphic, and much of the polymorphism influences the peptide-binding repertoire. However, despite this polymorphism, class I molecules can be clustered into sets of molecules that bind largely overlapping peptide repertoires. Almost a decade ago we introduced this concept of clustering human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and defined nine different groups, denominated as supertypes, on the basis of their main anchor specificity. The utility of this original supertype classification, as well several other subsequent arrangements derived by others, has been demonstrated in a large number of epitope identification studies.},

  abstract = {Purpose of Review
Over the past several years, one segment of the complex field of HIV transmission dynamics \textemdash{}heterosexual networks\textemdash{}has dominated theoretical and empirical investigation. This review provides an overview of recent work on HIV risks and networks, with a focus on recent findings in heterosexual network dynamics.

Recent findings
Qualitative (ethnographic) assessments have demonstrated the heterogeneity and complexity of heterosexual connections, particular in Africa where tradition, official polygamy, and unofficial multi-person arrangements lead to concurrency of sexual partnerships. A large, quantitative study on Likoma Island, Malawi, demonstrated the considerable, interlocking sexual connections that arise from a high-concurrency sexual setting, even with a low average number of partnerships (low-degree) of long duration. Such settings, as suggested by ethnographic studies, may be common in Africa and, coupled with newer information about transmissibility during acute and early infection, may provide a plausible explanation for endemic transmission and possibly for rapid HIV propagation.

Summary
Recognition of high- concurrency, low-degree networks is an important development for understanding HIV transmission dynamics. Their relevance to heterosexual transmission, and possible extension to other epidemiologic settings, reinforces the heterogeneity and complexity of HIV transmission dynamics.},

  abstract = {Purpose
After decades of research, AIDS continues to be a major pandemic and to date, adaptive immunity vaccine designs have had little to no success. Data indicate the alloimmune response is a potent mitigator of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, for which experiments of nature should be demonstrable to justify pursuit of an alloimmune vaccine strategy. We sought to determine if large-scale alloimmune diversity correlates with lower HIV infection rates.

Methods
Using published data of African linguistic groups to determine sub-Saharan country ethnicity profiles as a proxy for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) diversity, a correlation analysis was performed against respective sub-Saharan country HIV infection rates. Ethnicity data from 37 sub-Saharan nations in 2003 and from 38 nations in 2005 were used to calculate the Meyers-Macintosh ethnic diversity score for each nation as the independent variable. World Health Organization data on HIV infection rates for the same countries were used as the dependent variable. The main outcome measure was the correlation coefficient of ethnic diversity versus HIV infection rate.

Results
A significant negative correlation was shown between ethnic diversity and HIV infection: for 2003 data, -0.4586 (two-tailed P-value of 0.0043); and, for 2005 data, -0.3866 (two-tailed P-value of 0.0165).

Conclusion
In conjunction with substantial evidence that alloimmunity confers protection against HIV transmission and recent work identifying specific anti-HIV mechanisms, this analysis strongly justifies an HLA-based alloimmune vaccine strategy against HIV.},

  abstract = {This study was carried out to determine the effect of HIV-2 on HIV-1 \& 2 dually infected patients' response to antiretroviral therapy supposedly designed for HIV-1. HIV-1 and HIV-2 are distinct strains of viruses that cause AIDS. HIV-2 is known to be less pathogenic with a slower rate of CD4 depletion and a longer time of disease progression to AIDS. In contrast, HIV-1 is more pathogenic, depletes CD4 faster with a comparatively shorter time disease progression to AIDS. HIV-1 and HIV-2 differ in their nucleotide sequence and their genetic organization with just about 30\% homology between them. Therefore, one would expect that their replicative steps in an infected individual could possibly involve different enzymes and cellular factors. Available antiretroviral drugs target only HIV-1 and act by interfering with the replicative steps of the HIV virus. In line with this, a drug supposedly designed for HIV-1 might not provide enough inhibition for HIV-2. We specifically monitored the response of patients undergoing ART with HIV-2 alone infection and HIV -1 \& 2 dual infections and compared their response to patients with HIV-1. In all, 108 patients were enrolled into the study. Out of this, 87\% had HIV-1, 7\% had HIV-2 while 6\% had HIV-1 \& 2. The patients were monitored using their CD4 kinetics over a period of two years with a baseline CD4 and four consecutive counts performed at 6 months intervals. The results indicated that patients with HIV-2 infection responded favorably to the therapy just like HIV-1 infected patients. However, it appears that the synergistic effect of HIV-1 \& HIV- 2 in HIV-1 \& 2 dual infections contributed to a comparatively lower response to therapy. It was also found that, most probably, the modes of action of the drugs are on host factors but not virus specific factors. Not withstanding the difference in viral genome, HIV-2 patients responded well to the supposed HIV-1 specifically designed drugs.},

  abstract = {SummaryBackground
Unprotected sexual intercourse between regular heterosexual partners could elicit alloimmune responses that might be associated with inhibition of in-vitro HIV-1 infectivity. We investigated this hypothesis in people practising unprotected sex and those using protection.
Methods
We recruited 82 participants from an outpatient genitourinary medicine clinic. 29 monogamous heterosexual couples having unprotected sex; and 15 women and 10 men having condom protected or no sex. We used the mixed leucocyte reaction (MLR), stimulating one partner's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with the other partner's irradiated PBMC and compared the resulting response with control PBMC. We studied resistance to HIV-1 infection by challenging activated CD4-positive T cells with CCR5-binding and CXCR4-binding HIV-1 strains, and comparing the infectivity in participants having unprotected sex with those practising protected sex. We used the correlation coefficient to establish the significance of the relation between MLR and HIV-1 infectivity.
Findings
We recorded a significant increase in the stimulation indices in PBMC from women whose cells were stimulated with irradiated PBMC (2\%, 10\%, or 50\%) from their regular partners. The mean with 10\% partner's cells was 8$\cdot$6 (SD 7$\cdot$7), compared with those from unrelated cells (4$\cdot$7 [3$\cdot$9], p=0$\cdot$009). Significant alloimmune responses were also seen in corresponding male partners, but only with 50\% stimulating cells (p=0$\cdot$013). Dose-dependent inhibition of activated CD4-positive T cells to HIV-1 infection with both binding strains was noted in vitro in women practising unprotected intercourse, compared with those having protected sex or having no sex for more than 1 year. Highly significant differences were found for CCR5 (p=0$\cdot$0001) and for CXCR4 (p=0$\cdot$001) strains of HIV-1 at all four virus-concentrations. Male partners also showed in-vitro inhibition of HIV-1 but this was less than that in women.
Interpretation
Unprotected sexual intercourse might result in alloimmunisation stimulated by HLA antigens in seminal or cervicovaginal fluid. Mucosal alloimmunisation may reduce infection by HIV-1, and the role of such immunisation in preventive and therapeutic vaccination should be investigated.},

Whereas previous studies of sexual networks and HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan countries have focused solely on the personal networks of a small number of respondents, the LNS attempts to document the sexual networks of the entire adult population of Likoma. To do so, it uses a unique sociocentric study design, in which all members of the local population are contacted for a survey interview and are asked to nominate their five most recent sexual partners. Using these data, quasi-complete `maps' of the sexual networks connecting inhabitants of the island can be constructed. These maps allow investigation of the impact of networks on HIV epidemiology and can inform mathematical models of HIV prevention. In addition to data on sexual networks, the LNS data include information on the social networks (e.g. friendship), socioeconomic characteristics and HIV status of Likoma's residents. Baseline data were collected in 2005\textendash{}06. A first follow-up was conducted in 2007\textendash{}08 and a second follow-up is planned for early 2013.

To carry out the first large-scale population study of the prevalence of HLA\textendash{}B27 in the US, which is needed for public health planning purposes because of recent improvements in medical therapy and diagnostic testing for ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

Methods
The national prevalence of HLA\textendash{}B27 was determined as part of the 2009 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a cross-sectional survey monitoring the health and nutritional status of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population. DNA polymerase chain reaction analysis was conducted in samples from 2,320 adults ages 20\textendash{}69 years from this nationally representative sample.

Results
The age-adjusted US prevalence of B27 was 6.1\% (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 4.6\textendash{}8.2). By race/ethnicity, the prevalence of B27 was 7.5\% (95\% CI 5.3\textendash{}10.4) among non-Hispanic whites and 3.5\% (95\% CI 2.5\textendash{}4.8) among all other US races/ethnicities combined. In Mexican Americans, the prevalence was 4.6\% (95\% CI 3.4\textendash{}6.1). The prevalence of B27 could not be reliably estimated for other US racial/ethnic groups because of the low number of B27-positive individuals in those groups. For adults 50\textendash{}69 years of age, the prevalence of B27 was 3.6\% (95\% CI 2.2\textendash{}5.8), which suggested a decrease in B27 with age. These prevalence estimates took into account the NHANES survey design and are reviewed with respect to data from the medical literature.

Conclusion
Our findings provide the first US national prevalence estimates for HLA\textendash{}B27. A decline in the prevalence of HLA\textendash{}B27 with age is suggested by these data but must be confirmed by additional studies.},

To understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate human CCR5 gene expression, we initiated studies to determine its genomic and mRNA organization. Previous studies have identified a single CCR5 mRNA isoform whose open reading frame is intronless. We now report the following novel findings. 1) Complex alternative splicing and multiple transcription start sites give rise to several distinct CCR5 transcripts that differ in their 5${'}$-untranslated regions (UTR). 2) The gene is organized into four exons and two introns. Exons 2 and 3 are not interrupted by an intron. Exon 4 and portions of exon 3 are shared by all isoforms. Exon 4 contains the open reading frame, 11 nucleotides of the 5${'}$-UTR and the complete 3${'}$-UTR. 3) The transcripts appear to be initiated from two distinct promoters: an upstream promoter (PU), upstream of exon 1, and a downstream promoter (PD), that includes the ``intronic'' region between exons 1 and 3. 4) PU and PD lacked the canonical TATA or CAAT motifs, and are AT-rich. 5) PD demonstrated strong constitutive promoter activity, whereas PU was a weak promoter in all three leukocyte cell environments tested (THP-1, Jurkat, and K562). 6) We provide evidence for polymorphisms in the noncoding sequences, including the regulatory regions and 5${'}$-UTRs. The structure of CCR5 was strikingly reminiscent of the overall structure of other chemokine/chemoattractant receptors, underscoring an important evolutionarily conserved function for a prototypical gene structure. This is the first description of functional promoters for any CC chemokine receptor gene, and we speculate that the complex pattern of splicing events and dual promoter usage may function as a versatile mechanism to create diversity and flexibility in the regulation of CCR5 expression.},

We have been using evolutionary comparisons to trace (i) the origin(s) of HIV-1 and (ii) the origin(s) of AIDS. The closest relatives of HIV-1 are simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) infecting wild-living chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in west central Africa. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed the origins of HIV-1: chimpanzees were the original hosts of this clade of viruses; four lineages of HIV-1 have arisen by independent cross-species transmissions to humans and one or two of those transmissions may have been via gorillas. However, SIVs are primarily monkey viruses: more than 40 species of African monkeys are infected with their own, species-specific, SIV and in at least some host species, the infection seems non-pathogenic. Chimpanzees acquired from monkeys two distinct forms of SIVs that recombined to produce a virus with a unique genome structure. We have found that SIV infection causes CD4+ T-cell depletion and increases mortality in wild chimpanzees, and so the origin of AIDS is more ancient than the origin of HIV-1. Tracing the genetic changes that occurred as monkey viruses adapted to infect first chimpanzees and then humans may provide insights into the causes of the pathogenicity of these viruses.},

To date, it is still unclear whether this variance in the virulence of the infection is due to the host or to the virus genotype. One of the main difficulties in answering this question is that, as for most human diseases, we tend not to know who infected whom. Here, we solve this problem by adopting a phylogenetic approach, which estimates the heritability of species traits on a phylogeny. In our case, species correspond to infected patients and the trait is an infection trait. The phylogeny is obtained from the HIV RNA sequences isolated in each patient. We find that more than half of the variance observed in the set-point viral load\textemdash{}a trait that predicts virulence\textemdash{}is heritable from one infection to the next. This implies that set-point viral load is strongly controlled by the virus genotype. This application of the phylogenetic comparative approach to infectious diseases yields major results for the deciphering of HIV pathogenesis. Future applications to other traits and/or other pathogens will help us to better understand rapidly evolving diseases of humans.},

HIV-1 CTL epitope responses were present in four of six cases, 5\textendash{}18 months before seroconversion, and their presence was confirmed by bulk CTL culture. A possible viral escape mutation was found in one of six epitopes. The key epidemiologic correlate of late seroconversion was a reduction in sex work over the preceding year. In persistently uninfected controls, a break from sex work was associated with a loss of HIV-specific CD8+ responses. Late seroconversion may occur in HIV-1\textendash{}resistant sex workers despite preceding HIV-specific CD8+ responses. Seroconversion generally occurs in the absence of detectable CTL escape mutations and may relate to the waning of HIV-specific CD8+ responses due to reduced antigenic exposure.},

The 2008 Recommendations for care of the International AIDS Society reaffirmed the importance of both accurate and sensitive viral load assessment, and by necessity, access to viral load assays. HIV-1 viral load testing is considered essential when initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), when monitoring ART response, and when considering switching ART regimens. The demand for accurate, reproducible, and cost-effective viral load assays is therefore a global issue. Although the North American and Western European experience has historically been with HIV-1 group M subtype B virus, this paradigm is changing rapidly as migrants and refugees from developing countries with non-B subtype infections often now present for care in the developed world, and travelers to developing countries acquire non-B subtype infection abroad and present for care at home. Awareness of any clinical or laboratory differences between the common HIV-1 group M subtype B and the newer HIV-1 strains being seen in practice is therefore increasingly important. This review of current HIV-1 viral load testing is focused on the potential value of a standardized genotype assignment for HIV-1 viral subtypes, regular monitoring of the performance of available commercial HIV viral load assays on emerging non-B HIV subtypes, circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs), and a discussion of the implications for resource-limited settings.},

The CCR2V64I mutation is tightly linked to certain polymorphisms in the CCR5 gene. The current Omani population is genetically diverse, a reflection of their history as traders who ruled extensive regions around the Indian Ocean. In this study, we examined the CCR2-CCR5 haplotypes in Omanis and compared the patterns of genetic diversity with those of other populations. Blood samples were collected from 115 Omani adults and genomic DNA was screened to identify the polymorphic sites in the CCR5 gene and the CCR2V64I mutation. Four minor alleles were common: CCR5-2554T and CCR5-2086G showed frequencies of 49\% and 46\%, respectively, whereas CCR5-2459A and CCR5-2135C both had a frequency of 36\%. These alleles showed moderate levels of heterozygosity, indicating that they were under balancing selection. However, the well-known allele CCR5$\Delta$32 was relatively rare. Eleven haplotypes were identified, four of which were common: HHC (46\%), HHE (20\%), HHA (14\%) and HHF*2 (12\%).},

It differentially regulates the two major HIV-1 coreceptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, increasing CXCR4 and decreasing CCR5 expression in primary CD4(+) T-lymphocytes. In addition, IL-4 stimulates the expression of all HIV-1 isolates via a transcriptional activation mechanism. The combination of these effects results in increased propagation of CXCR4-using and inhibition of CCR5-using HIV-1 strains. IL-4 also activates HIV-1 expression in primary monocytes/macrophages but does not affect CCR5 expression. These results identify IL-4 as an important regulator of HIV-1 and suggest a critical role for this cytokine in the control of viral evolution and in the phenotypic switch from non-syncytia-inducing to syncytia-inducing, which leads to accelerated disease progression.},

The study of these may provide information about mechanisms of natural protective immunity to HIV-1.

These women have had frequent exposure to a range of African HIV-1 variants, primarily clades A, C, and D, for up to 12 yr without becoming infected. Nearly half of them have CTL directed towards epitopes previously defined for B clade virus, which are largely conserved in the A and D clade sequences. Stronger responses are frequently elicited using the A or D clade version of an epitope to stimulate CTL, suggesting that they were originally primed by exposure to these virus strains. CTL responses have been defined to novel epitopes presented by HLA class I molecules associated with resistance to infection in the cohort, HLA-A*6802 and HLA-B18. Estimates using a modified interferon-gamma Elispot assay indicate a circulating frequency of CTL to individual epitopes of between 1:3,200 and 1:50,000. Thus, HIV-specific immune responses-particularly cross-clade CTL activity- may be responsible for protection against persistent HIV infection in these African women.},

Analyses of such studies typically focus on pairwise comparisons of three different groups: HIV-1 positive individuals, HIV-1 high-risk seronegative individuals, and population controls. Because there is a clear expectation of how gene frequencies of risk or protective alleles would be ordered in the three groups, we are able to construct a statistical framework that offers a consistent increase in power over a wide-range of the magnitude of risk/protective effects. In this paper, we develop tests that constrain the alternative hypothesis to appropriately reflect risk or protective trends jointly across the three groups and show that they lead to a substantial increase in power over the naive pairwise approach. We develop both likelihood-ratio and score statistics that test for genetic effects across the three groups while constraining the alternative hypothesis to reflect biologically motivated trends of risk or protection. The asymptotic distribution of both statistics (likelihood ratio and score) is derived. We investigate the performance of our approach via extensive simulation studies using a biologically motivated model of HIV-1 acquisition, and find that our proposed approach leads to an increase in power of roughly 10-28\%. We illustrate our approach with an analysis of the effect of the CCR5$\Delta$32 mutation on HIV acquisition.},

Nevertheless, even though computational tools can guide the control of infectious diseases, few epidemiological models can simultaneously accommodate the inherent individual heterogeneity in multiple infectious disease traits influencing disease transmission, such as the frequently modeled propensity to become infected and infectivity, which describes the host ability to transmit the infection to susceptible individuals. Furthermore, current quantitative genetic models fail to fully capture the heritable variation in host infectivity, mainly because they cannot accommodate the nonlinear infection dynamics underlying epidemiological data. We present in this article a novel statistical model and an inference method to estimate genetic parameters associated with both host susceptibility and infectivity. Our methodology combines quantitative genetic models of social interactions with stochastic processes to model the random, nonlinear, and dynamic nature of infections and uses adaptive Bayesian computational techniques to estimate the model parameters. Results using simulated epidemic data show that our model can accurately estimate heritabilities and genetic risks not only of susceptibility but also of infectivity, therefore exploring a trait whose heritable variation is currently ignored in disease genetics and can greatly influence the spread of infectious diseases. Our proposed methodology offers potential impacts in areas such as livestock disease control through selective breeding and also in predicting and controlling the emergence of disease outbreaks in human populations.},

~Using epidemiological tracing data,\href{http://www.genetics.org/content/201/3/871#ref-41}{Lloyd-Smith~\emph{et al.}~(2005)}~established a link between recent large-scale outbreaks and the presence of superspreaders characterized by a small proportion of highly infectious individuals, thus providing evidence for phenotypic, although not genetic, variation in infectiousness.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

However, the binary disease status (healthy/diseased) of an individual undergoing an epidemic is a function of the interaction of its susceptibility and the time-varying infection pressure exerted by the infected individuals (\href{http://www.genetics.org/content/201/3/871#ref-31}{Keeling and Rohani 2008}). Hence, the linearity and static nature of current IGE models are unrealistic assumptions when dealing with the stochastic nonlinear dynamics underlying disease transmission.

However, virtually all these resources involve incompatible formats, are based on different modeling languages, and lack appropriate tooling and programming interfaces (APIs) that hinder their wide-scale adoption and usage in a variety of application contexts. The Lexical Grid (LexGrid) project introduced in this paper is an ongoing community-driven initiative, coordinated by the Mayo Clinic Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, designed to bridge this gap using a common terminology model called the LexGrid model. The key aspect of the model is to accommodate multiple vocabulary and ontology distribution formats and support of multiple data stores for federated vocabulary distribution. The model provides a foundation for building consistent and standardized APIs to access multiple vocabularies that support lexical search queries, hierarchy navigation, and a rich set of features such as recursive subsumption (e.g., get all the children of the concept penicillin). Existing LexGrid implementations include the LexBIG API as well as a reference implementation of the HL7 Common Terminology Services (CTS) specification providing programmatic access via Java, Web, and Grid services.},

  abstract = {Many important questions in biology are, fundamentally, comparative, and this extends to our analysis of a growing number of sequenced genomes. Existing genomic analysis tools are often organized around literal views of genomes as linear strings. Even when information is highly condensed, these views grow cumbersome as larger numbers of genomes are added. Data aggregation and summarization methods from the field of visual analytics can provide abstracted comparative views, suitable for sifting large multi-genome datasets to identify critical similarities and differences. We introduce a software system for visual analysis of comparative genomics data. The system automates the process of data integration, and provides the analysis platform to identify and explore features of interest within these large datasets. GenoSets borrows techniques from business intelligence and visual analytics to provide a rich interface of interactive visualizations supported by a multi-dimensional data warehouse. In GenoSets, visual analytic approaches are used to enable querying based on orthology, functional assignment, and taxonomic or user-defined groupings of genomes. GenoSets links this information together with coordinated, interactive visualizations for both detailed and high-level categorical analysis of summarized data. GenoSets has been designed to simplify the exploration of multiple genome datasets and to facilitate reasoning about genomic comparisons. Case examples are included showing the use of this system in the analysis of 12 Brucella genomes. GenoSets software and the case study dataset are freely available at http://genosets.uncc.edu. We demonstrate that the integration of genomic data using a coordinated multiple view approach can simplify the exploration of large comparative genomic data sets, and facilitate reasoning about comparisons and features of interest.},

  abstract = {Foreword by Tom Peters Internationally known management consultants Nicholas Imparato and Oren Harari connect the big picture of our changing civilizations with the specific practical actions that managers have to take to produce results today. All organizations are faced with the same challenge: the need to jump the curve to make significant, discontinuous leaps in their thinking, whether about product, technology, or management style. The alternative to follow current practices all the way to their inevitable decline is unacceptable. The authors show us that it is also unnecessary. Drawing on numerous personal interviews with innovative leaders around the world, as well as research and first-hand observation, Imparato and Harari identify the four strategic imperatives--innovation, intelligence, coherence, and responsibility--that will enable companies to successfully jump the curve and thrive in the emerging epoch. And they show how cutting-edge companies and leaders are translating these imperatives into action. Not since the dawn of the Modern Age some five hundred years ago has civilization undergone the kind of profound, rapid-fire changes we're experiencing today. Even organizations that are adapting, growing and innovating have the gnawing sense that obsolescence is right around the corner. Jumping the Curve offers perspective and guidance for doing business at this unique moment in time. It connects the big picture of our changing world with the practical actions managers must take now to position their organizations for success in a new epoch we can't yet fully see or understand.},

Integration of clinicopathologic data alone is a major task given the number of data elements involved. For a translational research environment, it is critical to make these data usable at the point-of-need. Individual systems have been developed to meet the needs of particular projects though the need for a generalizable system has been recognized. Increased use of Electronic Medical Record data in translational research will demand generalizing the system for integrating clinical data to support the study of a broad range of human diseases. To ultimately satisfy these needs, we have developed a system to support multiple translational research projects. This system, the Data Warehouse for Translational Research (DW4TR), is based on a light-weight, patient-centric modularly-structured clinical data model and a specimen-centric molecular data model. The temporal relationships of the data are also part of the model. The data are accessed through an interface composed of an Aggregated Biomedical-Information Browser (ABB) and an Individual Subject Information Viewer (ISIV) which target general users. The system was developed to support a breast cancer translational research program and has been extended to support a gynecological disease program. Further extensions of the \{DW4TR\} are underway.

These ants deposit pheromone on the ground in order to mark some favorable path that should be followed by other members of the colony. Ant colony optimization exploits a similar mechanism for solving optimization problems. From the early nineties, when the first ant colony optimization algorithm was proposed, ACO attracted the attention of increasing numbers of researchers and many successful applications are now available. Moreover, a substantial corpus of theoretical results is becoming available that provides useful guidelines to researchers and practitioners in further applications of ACO.

  abstract = {The rate of increase in hard disk storage capacity continues to outpace the rate of decrease in hard disk seek time. This trend implies that the value of a seek is increasing exponentially relative to the value of storage.

With this trend in mind, we introduce the partitioned exponential file (PE file) which is a generic storage manager that can be customized for many different types of data (e.g., numerical, spatial, or temporal). The PE file is intended for use in environments with intense update loads and concurrent, analytic queries. Such an environment may be found, for example, in long-running scientific applications which can produce petabytes of data. For example, the proposed Large Synoptic Survey Telescope [36] will produce 50\textendash{}100 petabytes of observational, scientific data over its multi-year lifetime. This database will never be taken off-line, so bursty update loads of tens of terabytes per day must be handled concurrently with data analysis. In the PE file, data are organized as a series of on-disk sorts with a careful, global organization. Because the PE file relies heavily on sequential I/O, only a fraction of a disk seek is required for a typical record insertion or retrieval.

In addition to describing the PE file, we also detail a set of benchmarking experiments for T1SM, which is a PE file customized for use with multi-attribute data records ordered on a single numerical attribute. In our benchmarking, we implement and test many competing data organizations that can be used to index and store such data, such as the B+-Tree, the LSM-Tree, the Buffer Tree, the Stepped Merge Method, and the Y-Tree. As expected, no organization is the best over all benchmarks, but our experiments show that T1SM is the best choice in many situations, suggesting that it is the best overall. Specifically, T1SM performs exceptionally well in the case of a heavy query workload that must be handled concurrently with an intense insertion stream. Our experiments show that T1SM (and its close cousin, the T2SM storage manager for spatial data) can handle very heavy mixed workloads of this type, and still maintain acceptably small query latencies.},

  abstract = {In order to solve the image segmentation problem which assigns a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain visual characteristics more effectively, a novel approach based on memetic algorithm (MISA) is proposed. Watershed segmentation is applied to segment original images into non-overlap small regions before performing the portioning process by MISA. MISA adopts a straightforward representation method to find the optimal combination of watershed regions under the criteria of interclass variance in feature space. After implementing cluster-based crossover and mutation, an individual learning procedure moves exocentric regions in current cluster to the one they should belong to according to the distance between these regions and cluster centers in feature space. In order to evaluate the new algorithm, six texture images, three remote sensing images and three natural images are employed in experiments. The experimental results show that MISA outperforms its genetic version, the Fuzzy c-means algorithm, and K-means algorithm in partitioning most of the test problems, and is an effective approach when compared with two state-ofthe-art image segmentation algorithms including an efficient graph-based algorithm and a spectral clustering ensemble-based algorithm.},

  abstract = {Image segmentation is the critical task of partitioning an image into multiple objects. Deformable Models are effective tools aimed at performing image segmentation. Among them, Topological Active Nets (TANs), and their extension, ETANs, are models integrating features of region-based and boundary-based segmentation techniques. Since the deformation of the meshes composing these models to fit the objects to be segmented is controlled by an energy functional, the segmentation task is tackled as a numerical optimization problem. Despite their good performance, the existing ETAN optimization method (based on a local search) can lead to result inaccuracies, that is, local optima in the sense of optimization. This paper introduces a novel optimization approach by embedding ETANs in a global search memetic framework, Scatter Search, thus considering multiple alternatives in the segmentation process using a very small solution population. With the aim of improving the accuracy of the segmentation results in a reasonable processing time, we introduce a global search-suitable internal energy term, a diversity function, a frequency memory population generator and two proper solution combination operators. In particular, these operators are effective in coalescing multiple meshes, a task previous global search methods for TAN optimization failed to accomplish. The proposal has been tested on a mix of 20 synthetic and real medical images with different segmentation difficulties. Its performance has been compared with two ETAN optimization approaches (the original local search and a new multi-start local search) as well as with the state-of-the-art memetic proposal for classical TAN optimization based on differential evolution. Our new method significantly outperformed the other three for the given set of images in terms of four standard segmentation metrics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Risk-adjusted mortality and morbidity rates are often used as measures of the quality of surgical care. This study was conducted to determine the validity of risk-adjusted surgical morbidity and mortality rates as measures of quality of care by assessing the process and structure of care in surgical services with higher-than-expected and lower-than-expected risk-adjusted 30-day mortality and morbidity rates.
STUDY DESIGN: A structural survey of 44 Veterans Affairs Medical Center surgical services and site visits to 20 surgical services with higher-than-expected and lower-than-expected risk-adjusted outcomes were conducted. Main outcome measures included assessment of technology and equipment, technical competence of staff, leadership, relationship with other services, monitoring of quality of care, coordination of work, relationship with affiliated institutions, and overall quality of care.
RESULTS: Surgical services with lower-than-expected risk-adjusted surgical morbidity and mortality rates had significantly more equipment available in surgical intensive care units than did services with higher-than-expected outcomes (4.3 versus 2.9, p $<$ 0.05). Site-visitor ratings of overall quality of care were significantly higher for surgical services with lower-than-expected morbidity and mortality rates (6.1 versus 4.5 for high outliers, p $<$ 0.05); technology and equipment were rated significantly better among low-outlier services (7.1 versus 4.8 for high outliers, p $<$ 0.001). Masked site-visit teams correctly predicted the outlier status (high versus low) of 17 of the 20 surgical services visited (p $<$ 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in several dimensions of process and structure of the delivery of surgical care are associated with differences in risk-adjusted surgical morbidity and mortality rates among 44 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers.},

A surgical clinical nurse reviewer collects 135 clinical variables including preoperative risk factors, intraoperative variables, and 30-day postoperative mortality and morbidity outcomes for patients undergoing major surgical procedures. A report on mortality and complications is prepared twice a year. This article summarizes briefly the history of NSQIP and how its report on surgical outcomes can be used for performance improvement within a hospital system. In particular, it describes how to drive performance improvement with NSQIP data using the example of postoperative respiratory complications--a major factor of postoperative mortality. In addition, this article explains the benefit of a collaborative of several participating NSQIP hospitals and describes how to develop a "playbook" on the basis of an outcome improvement project.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Risk-adjusted mortality and morbidity rates are often used as measures of the quality of surgical care. This study was conducted to determine the validity of risk-adjusted surgical morbidity and mortality rates as measures of quality of care by assessing the process and structure of care in surgical services with higher-than-expected and lower-than-expected risk-adjusted 30-day mortality and morbidity rates.
STUDY DESIGN: A structural survey of 44 Veterans Affairs Medical Center surgical services and site visits to 20 surgical services with higher-than-expected and lower-than-expected risk-adjusted outcomes were conducted. Main outcome measures included assessment of technology and equipment, technical competence of staff, leadership, relationship with other services, monitoring of quality of care, coordination of work, relationship with affiliated institutions, and overall quality of care.
RESULTS: Surgical services with lower-than-expected risk-adjusted surgical morbidity and mortality rates had significantly more equipment available in surgical intensive care units than did services with higher-than-expected outcomes (4.3 versus 2.9, p $<$ 0.05). Site-visitor ratings of overall quality of care were significantly higher for surgical services with lower-than-expected morbidity and mortality rates (6.1 versus 4.5 for high outliers, p $<$ 0.05); technology and equipment were rated significantly better among low-outlier services (7.1 versus 4.8 for high outliers, p $<$ 0.001). Masked site-visit teams correctly predicted the outlier status (high versus low) of 17 of the 20 surgical services visited (p $<$ 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in several dimensions of process and structure of the delivery of surgical care are associated with differences in risk-adjusted surgical morbidity and mortality rates among 44 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers.},

Valid inferences from such data require the ability to account for disease severity and comorbid conditions. We adapted a clinical comorbidity index, designed for use with medical records, for research relying on International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis and procedure codes. The association of this adapted index with health outcomes and resource use was then examined with a sample of Medicare beneficiaries who underwent lumbar spine surgery in 1985 (n = 27,111). The index was associated in the expected direction with postoperative complications, mortality, blood transfusion, discharge to nursing home, length of hospital stay, and hospital charges. These associations were observed whether the index incorporated data from multiple hospitalizations over a year's time, or just from the index surgical admission. They also persisted after controlling for patient age. We conclude that the adapted comorbidity index will be useful in studies of disease outcome and resource use employing administrative databases.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a prospectively applicable method for classifying comorbid conditions which might alter the risk of mortality for use in longitudinal studies. A weighted index that takes into account the number and the seriousness of comorbid disease was developed in a cohort of 559 medical patients. The 1-yr mortality rates for the different scores were: "0", 12\% (181); "1-2", 26\% (225); "3-4", 52\% (71); and "greater than or equal to 5", 85\% (82). The index was tested for its ability to predict risk of death from comorbid disease in the second cohort of 685 patients during a 10-yr follow-up. The percent of patients who died of comorbid disease for the different scores were: "0", 8\% (588); "1", 25\% (54); "2", 48\% (25); "greater than or equal to 3", 59\% (18). With each increased level of the comorbidity index, there were stepwise increases in the cumulative mortality attributable to comorbid disease (log rank chi 2 = 165; p less than 0.0001). In this longer follow-up, age was also a predictor of mortality (p less than 0.001). The new index performed similarly to a previous system devised by Kaplan and Feinstein. The method of classifying comorbidity provides a simple, readily applicable and valid method of estimating risk of death from comorbid disease for use in longitudinal studies. Further work in larger populations is still required to refine the approach because the number of patients with any given condition in this study was relatively small.},

The aim of this study was to investigate Black MSM's sexual mixing patterns and partner characteristics in relation to sexual risk taking, as a possible explanation for this observed increase in HIV incidence. Between January and July 2008, 197 Black MSM were recruited via modified respondent-driven sampling and completed optional pretest and post-test HIV serological testing, counseling, and a demographic, behavioral, and psychosocial assessment battery. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to examine predictors of risky sex across partner types. Overall, 18\% of the sample was HIV-infected; 50\% reported unprotected intercourse with men, 30\% with women, and 5\% with transgender partners. Fifty-three percent identified as bisexual or straight, although all reported oral or anal sex with another man in the prior 12~months. Significant predictors of engaging in at least one episode of: (1) serodiscordant unprotected anal sex (UAS) with a male partner in the past 12~months: individuals at risk for social isolation (AOR\,=\,4.23; p\,=\,0.03), those with unstable housing (AOR\,=\,4.19; p\,=\,0.03), and those who used poppers at least weekly during sex (AOR\,=\,5.90; p\,=\,0.05); (2) UAS and/or unprotected vaginal intercourse with a female partner in the past 12~months: those with unstable housing (AOR\,=\,4.85; p\,=\,0.04), those who used cocaine at least weekly during sex (AOR\,=\,16.78; p\,=\,0.006), being HIV-infected (AOR\,=\,0.07; p\,=\,0.02), and feeling social norms favor condom use (AOR\,=\,0.60; p\,=\,0.05); (3) UAS with the participants' most recent nonmain male sex partner: use of alcohol and drugs during last sex by participant (AOR\,=\,4.04; p\,=\,0.01), having sex with a Hispanic/Latino male (AOR\,=\,2.71; p\,=\,0.04) or a Black male (AOR\,=\,0.50; p\,=\,0.05) compared to a White male, and lower education (AOR\,=\,1.31; p\,=\,0.02). Findings suggest that sexual risk behaviors of Black MSM differ across partner type and by the characteristics of their sexual networks and that this subpopulation of MSM are at high risk for HIV acquisition and transmission. Effective prevention strategies need to address the distinct sexual and behavioral risk patterns presented by different sexual partnerships reported by Black MSM.},

  abstract = {SummaryBackground
HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China is rapidly increasing. The majority of Chinese MSM engage in bisexual behaviors and their female partners may be at high risk of HIV infection.
Methods
Through a comprehensive literature review and the utilization of a mathematical optimization approach, this study infers quantitative distributions of sexual behavioral practices between Chinese MSM and their female partners over the past decade, and consequently estimates the trends in HIV incidence rates among female partners of Chinese MSM.
Results
The average Chinese MSM had approximately 0.89 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.68\textendash{}1.23) female sexual partners, with a mean number of total penetrative acts with the female partners of 0.57 (95\% CI 0.52\textendash{}0.62), in the past 6 months. Condom usage increased slightly from 23.57\% (95\% CI 14.20\textendash{}32.93\%) in 2002 to 27.33\% (95\% CI 19.88\textendash{}34.78\%) in 2010. Thus, the substantially increasing HIV prevalence among MSM has led to an increase in HIV incidence among partners of bisexual MSM of approximately 5.3-fold, from 0.18 per 1000 person-years in 2002 to 0.88 per 1000 person-years in 2010.
Conclusions
Bisexual Chinese MSM may be a bridge group to the general female population for HIV transmission. There has been a substantial HIV incidence increase among their female partners.},

We conducted semistructured interviews with 38 Black men in Atlanta, Georgia, who reported having had oral, vaginal, or anal sex with both men and women in the prior 6 months., Results. Participants described approaches to disclosure of same-sex behavior as part of a complex decisional balance influenced by both situational and individual factors and ranging from full disclosure to total secrecy. Influences on sexual behavior and condom-use practices included: (1) type of relationship, (2) gender-specific considerations, (3) perceptions of comfort or trust, and (4) fear of disease or pregnancy., Conclusions. Disclosure of same-sex behavior was not a major influence on the sexual behavior and condom-use practices of the Black bisexual men in our study, who demonstrated heterogeneity in approaches to sexual behavior, disclosure of same-sex behavior, and condom-use practices. Additional research is needed to assess the social determinants of sexual risk for this population.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the protective effect of metformin against death is modified by frailty status in older adults with type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cohort study during October 1, 1999-September 30, 2006 among veterans aged 65-89 years old with type 2 diabetes but without history of liver, renal diseases, or cancers, who had sulfonylureas or metformin as the sole antidiabetic drug for $\geq$180 days. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to compare hazard rates of all-cause mortality between the metformin and sulfonylurea users adjusting for the propensity score of metformin use and covariates: age, race/ethnicity, diabetes duration, Charlson comorbidity score, statin use, smoking status, BMI, LDL, and HbA1c.
RESULTS: In this cohort of 2,415 veterans, 307 (12.7\%) were metformin users, 2,108 (87.3\%) were sulfonylurea users, the mean age was 73.7$\pm$5.2 years, the mean study period was 5.6$\pm$2.3 years, the mean HbA1c at baseline was 6.7$\pm$1.0\%, 23\% had diabetes for $\geq$10 years, and 43.6\% (N=1,048) died during the study period. For patients with and without frailty, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of death for metformin vs. sulfonylurea use were 0.92 (95\% CI=0.90-1.31, p-value=0.19) and 0.69 (95\% CI = 0.60-0.79, p-value$<$0.001), respectively. Logistic regression analyses showed that metformin (vs. sulfonylurea) was significantly associated with a decreased odds of frailty (OR: 0.66, 95\% CI: 0.61-0.71, p-value $<$.0001).
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that metformin could potentially promote longevity via preventing frailty in older adults with type 2 diabetes.},

Frail patients are vulnerable to undergoing adverse events, to developing geriatric syndromes and to experiencing functional decline during or due to hospitalization. The strategy for providing specialized geriatric care to these hospitalized frail elderly patients currently consists of care provision either by specialized departments or by specialized teams who adopt comprehensive geriatric assessment. Even so, financial and human resources are insufficient to meet the needs of all hospitalized frail elderly patients who require comprehensive geriatric assessment. New innovative and more efficient geriatric interventions, in which the priorities of the patients themselves should be the main focus, should be developed and implemented, and professionals in all specialties should be educated in applying the fundamentals of geriatric medicine to their frail elderly patients. In the evaluation of such interventions, patient-reported outcomes should play a major role, in addition to the more traditional outcome measures of effectiveness, quality of care and cost-effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Background and Objective Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has modified the clinical course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, reducing the rate of disease progression, the incidence of opportunistic infections and mortality. Several recent studies show early antiretroviral therapy reduces the risk of AIDS and HIV-related disease. The aim of this study was to perform an economic analysis to estimate the cost-utility of early antiretroviral therapy in Italy for managing HIV-infected patients. Methods The incremental cost-utility analysis was carried out to quantify the benefits of the early-treatment approach in HIV subjects. A Markov simulation model including direct costs and health outcomes was developed from a third-party (Italian National Healthcare Service) payer's perspective for four CD4 strata. 5000 Monte Carlo simulations were performed on two distinct scenarios: Standard of care (SoC) in which 30 \% of patients started HAART with a CD4 count $\geq$500 cells/mm3 versus the early-treatment scenario (ETS), where the number of patients starting HAART with a CD4 count $\geq$500 cells/mm3 increased to 70 \%. A systematic literature review was carried out to identify epidemiological and economic data, which were subsequently used to inform the model. In addition, a one-way probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed in order to measure the relationship between the effectiveness of the treatments and the number of patients to undergo early treatment. Results The model shows, in terms of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained, that early treatment appeared to be the most cost-effective option compared to SoC (ICER = \texteuro{}13,625) over a time horizon of 10 years. The cost effectiveness of ETS is more sustainable as it extends the time horizon analysis (ICER = \texteuro{}7526 per QALY to 20 years and \texteuro{}8382 per QALY to 30 years). The one-way sensitivity analysis on the main variables confirmed the robustness of the model for the early-treatment approach. Conclusion Our model represents a tool for policy makers and health-care professionals to provide information on the cost effectiveness of the early-treatment approach in HIV-infected patients in Italy. Starting HAART earlier keeps HIV-infected patients in better health and reduces the incidence of AIDS- and non-AIDS-related events, generating a gain in terms of both patients' health and correct resource allocation.},

  doi = {10.1186/s12879-016-1462-x},
  abstract = {Background
Opportunistic illnesses still account for a huge proportion of hospitalizations and deaths among HIV-infected patients in the post combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) era, particularly in middle- and low-income countries. The aim of this study was to assess predictors of the top four most incident opportunistic illnesses (tuberculosis, esophageal candidiasis, cerebral toxoplasmosis and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia) in an HIV clinical cohort from a middle-income country in the post cART era.

Methods
A total of 2835 HIV infected participants aged\,$\geq$\,18~years at enrollment were followed from January 2000 to December 2012 until the occurrence of their first opportunistic illness, death or end of study, whichever occurred first. Extended Cox proportional hazards regression models, stratified by use of cART, were fitted to assess predictors of opportunistic illness incidence during follow-up.

Results
The incidence rates of tuberculosis, esophageal candidiasis, cerebral toxoplasmosis and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia were 15.3, 8.6, 6.0, 4.8 per 1000 persons-year, respectively. Disease specific adjusted Cox models showed that presence of an opportunistic illness at enrollment significantly increased disease incidence while higher nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count had a significant protective effect in patients not in use of cART. Duration of cART use also significantly reduced disease incidence.

Conclusions
Our findings show that, still in the post-cART era, prevention of opportunistic infections can be achieved by preventing immune deterioration by instituting early use of cART. Interventions focusing on early diagnosis and linkage to care in addition to the prompt initiation of cART are essential to reduce the incidence of opportunistic illnesses among HIV infected patients in post-cART era.},

  abstract = {Background/Aims: The frequencies of opportunistic diseases (ODs) vary across countries based on genetic, environmental, and social differences. The Korean HIV/AIDS cohort study was initiated in 2006 to promote research on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Korea, and to provide a logistical network to support multicenter projects on epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory aspects of HIV infection. This study evaluated the prevalence of ODs among HIV-infected patients in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy, and the risk factors associated with ODs.
Methods: The study enrolled 1,086 HIV-infected patients from 19 hospitals. This study examined the baseline data of the HIV/AIDS Korean cohort study at the time of enrollment from December 2006 to July 2013.
Results: Candidiasis was the most prevalent opportunistic infection (n = 176, 16.2\%), followed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (n = 120, 10.9\%), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (n = 121, 11.0\%), cytomegalovirus infection (n = 52, 4.7\%), and herpes zoster (n = 44, 4.0\%). The prevalence rates of Kaposi's sarcoma (n = 8, 0.7\%) and toxoplasmosis (n = 4, 0.4\%) were very low compared with other countries. The risk factors for ODs were a low CD4 T cell count at the time of HIV diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.01; p $<$ 0.01), current smoking (OR, 2.27; p = 0.01), current alcohol use (OR, 2.57; p = 0.04), and a history of tuberculosis (OR, 5.23; p $<$ 0.01).
Conclusions: Using recent Korean nationwide data, this study demonstrated that an important predictor of ODs was a low CD4 T cell count at the time of HIV diagnosis. Tuberculosis remains one of the most important ODs in HIV-infected patients in Korea.},

Studies suggest that CD4 counts early in HIV infection do not predict relevant public health outcomes such as disease progression, mortality, and HIV transmission in people living with HIV. CD4 counts also vary widely within individuals and among populations, leading to imprecise measurements and arbitrary ART initiation. To capture the clinical and preventive benefits of treatment, the global HIV response now focuses on increasing HIV diagnosis and ART coverage. CD4 counts for ART initiation were necessary when medications were expensive and had severe side effects, and when the impact of early ART initiation was unclear. However, current evidence suggests that although CD4 counts may still play a role in guiding clinical care to start prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, CD4 counts should cease to be required for ART initiation.},

A total of 194 antiretroviral therapy na\"ive HIV-positive patients (18-60 years) were taken as cases and 98 age- and sex-matched HIV-negative family members as controls. Demographical, clinical, biochemical, and microbiological parameters were studied.

Statistical Analysis Used:
Odds ratio, 95\% confidence interval, and P ($<$ 0.05 is to be significant) were calculated using Epi Info 7 software.

Results:
POI was significantly higher among HIV-seropositive cases (61.86\%) (P $<$ 0.001). Cryptosporidium was the most common POI in HIV-seropositive patients overall and without diarrhea; Entameba was the most common POI in patients with acute diarrhea, and Isospora was the most common POI in the patients having chronic diarrhea. Entameba was the most common POI in CD4 count $<$350 cells/$\mu$l while for CD4 count $>$350 cells/$\mu$l Cryptosporidium was the most common POI. Mean CD4 count was significantly (P $<$ 0.001) lower among people having multiple infections. Male sex, hemoglobin $<$10 g/dl, WHO Clinical Stage 3 or 4, tuberculosis, absolute eosinophil count of more than 540/dl, CD4 count $<$350 cells/$\mu$l, and seroconcordance of spouses were significantly associated with HIV-seropositive cases having POI (P $<$ 0.05).

Conclusions:
Physicians should advise HIV-infected patients to undergo routine evaluation for POI, and provision of chemoprophylaxis should be made in appropriate settings.},

  abstract = {Background
Polymorphisms in CCR5, the major coreceptor for HIV, and CCL3L1, a potent CCR5 ligand and HIV-suppressive chemokine, are determinants of HIV-AIDS susceptibility. Here, we mathematically modeled the potential impact of these genetic factors on the epidemic spread of HIV, as well as on its prevention. 
  
 Methods and Results 
  Ro , the basic reproductive number, is a fundamental concept in explaining the emergence and persistence of epidemics. By modeling sexual transmission among HIV+/HIV- partner pairs, we find that  Ro  estimates, and concordantly, the temporal and spatial patterns of HIV outgrowth are highly dependent on the infecting partners'  CCL3L1-CCR5  genotype.  Ro  was least and highest when the infected partner possessed protective and detrimental  CCL3L1-CCR5  genotypes, respectively. The modeling data indicate that in populations such as Pygmies with a high  CCL3L1  gene dose and protective  CCR5  genotypes, the spread of HIV might be minimal. Additionally,  Pc , the critical vaccination proportion, an estimate of the fraction of the population that must be vaccinated successfully to eradicate an epidemic was \&lt;1 only when the infected partner had a protective  CCL3L1-CCR5  genotype. Since in practice  Pc  cannot be \&gt;1, to prevent epidemic spread, population groups defined by specific  CCL3L1-CCR5  genotypes might require repeated vaccination, or as our models suggest, a vaccine with an efficacy of \&gt;70\%. Further, failure to account for  CCL3L1-CCR5 -based genetic risk might confound estimates of vaccine efficacy. For example, in a modeled trial of 500 subjects, misallocation of  CCL3L1-CCR5  genotype of only 25 (5\%) subjects between placebo and vaccine arms results in a relative error of $\sim$12\% from the true vaccine efficacy. 
  
 Conclusions 
  CCL3L1-CCR5  genotypes may impact on the dynamics of the HIV epidemic and, consequently, the observed heterogeneous global distribution of HIV infection. As  Ro  is lowest when the infecting partner has beneficial  CCL3L1-CCR5  genotypes, we infer that therapeutic vaccines directed towards reducing the infectivity of the host may play a role in halting epidemic spread. Further,  CCL3L1-CCR5  genotype may provide critical guidance for optimizing the design and evaluation of HIV-1 vaccine trials and prevention programs.},

Given the importance of the VL in transmission, it is likely that such subjects will transmit virus at very low rates. Thus, the data indicating that~\emph{Ro}~is lowest in HIV+/HIV- partner pairs in which the transmitting partner has a low-risk GRG status suggest that vaccines directed towards reducing infectivity of the HIV+ host may play an important role in halting epidemic spread. Underscoring this, findings from animal studies~\href{http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003671#pone.0003671-Desrosiers1}{[67]}~and mathematical modeling~\href{http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003671#pone.0003671-Anderson1}{[1]},~\href{http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003671#pone.0003671-Blower1}{[2]},~\href{http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003671#pone.0003671-AbuRaddad1}{[68]},~\href{http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003671#pone.0003671-Amirfar1}{[69]}~support the hope that imperfect, T-cell based disease-modifying, i.e., therapeutic vaccines, by reducing plasma viral load at the population level might abate the epidemic.

The model focuses on viral load reduction or increase by genetic etc factors and the combination of the HIV negative partner and the viral load of the HIV positive partner. It allows us to target certain populations and genetic profiles with interventions and model the effect.}

We show that there are significant interindividual and interpopulation differences in the copy number of a segmental duplication encompassing the gene encoding CCL3L1 (MIP-1$\alpha$P), a potent human immunodeficiency virus\textendash{}1 (HIV-1)\textendash{}suppressive chemokine and ligand for the HIV coreceptor CCR5. Possession of a CCL3L1 copy number lower than the population average is associated with markedly enhanced HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) susceptibility. This susceptibility is even greater in individuals who also possess disease-accelerating CCR5 genotypes. This relationship between CCL3L1 dose and altered HIV/AIDS susceptibility points to a central role for CCL3L1 in HIV/AIDS pathogenesis and indicates that differences in the dose of immune response genes may constitute a genetic basis for variable responses to infectious diseases.
Analysis of gene numbers of an anti-HIV chemokine in people from many ethnic groups shows that individuals with more copies resist HIV infection more effectively.

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0075624},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individual-based modeling is a growing technique in the HIV transmission and prevention literature, but insufficient attention has been paid to formally evaluate the quality of reporting in this field. We present reporting recommendations for individual-based models for HIV treatment and prevention, assess the quality of reporting in the existing literature, and comment on the contribution of this model type to HIV policy and prediction.
METHODS: We developed reporting recommendations for individual-based HIV transmission mathematical models, and through a systematic search, used them to evaluate the reporting in the existing literature. We identified papers that employed individual-based simulation models and were published in English prior to December 31, 2012. Articles were included if the models they employed simulated and tracked individuals, simulated HIV transmission between individuals in a particular population, and considered a particular treatment or prevention intervention. The papers were assessed with the reporting recommendations.
FINDINGS: Of 214 full text articles examined, 32 were included in the evaluation, representing 20 independent individual-based HIV treatment and prevention mathematical models. Manuscripts universally reported the objectives, context, and modeling conclusions in the context of the modeling assumptions and the model's predictive capabilities, but the reporting of individual-based modeling methods, parameterization and calibration was variable. Six papers discussed the time step used and one discussed efforts to maintain internal validity in coding.
CONCLUSION: Individual-based models represent detailed HIV transmission processes with the potential to contribute to inference and policy making for many different regions and populations. The rigor in reporting of assumptions, methods, and calibration of individual-based models focused on HIV transmission and prevention varies greatly. Higher standards for reporting of statistically rigorous calibration and model assumption testing need to be implemented to increase confidence in existing and future modeling results.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The core-group theory of sexually transmitted infections suggests that targeting prevention to high-risk groups (HRG) could be very effective. We aimed to quantify the contribution of heterosexual HRGs and the potential impact of focused interventions to HIV transmission in the wider community.
METHODS: We systematically identified studies published between 1980 and 2011. Studies were included if they used dynamical models of heterosexual HIV transmission, incorporated behavioural heterogeneity in risk, and provided at least one of the following primary estimates in the wider community (a) the population attributable fraction (PAF) of HIV infections due to HRGs, or (b) the number per capita or fraction of HIV infections averted, or change in HIV prevalence/incidence due to focused interventions.
FINDINGS: Of 267 selected articles, 22 were included. Four studies measured the PAF, and 20 studies measured intervention impact across 265 scenarios. In low-prevalence epidemics ($\leq$5\% HIV prevalence), the estimated impact of sex-worker interventions in the absence of risk compensation included: 6-100\% infections averted; 0.9-6.2 HIV infections averted per 100,000 adults; 11-94\% and 4-47\% relative reduction in prevalence and incidence respectively. In high-prevalence epidemics ($>$5\% HIV prevalence), sex-worker interventions were estimated to avert 6.8-40\% of HIV infections and up to 564 HIV infections per 100,000 adults, and reduce HIV prevalence and incidence by 13-27\% and 2-14\% respectively. In both types of epidemics, greater heterogeneity in HIV risk was associated with a larger impact on the fraction of HIV infections averted and relative reduction in HIV incidence.
CONCLUSION: Focused interventions, as estimated by mathematical models, have the potential to reduce HIV transmission in the wider community across low- and high-prevalence regions. However, considerable variability exists in estimated impact, suggesting that a targeted approach to HIV prevention should be tailored to local epidemiological context.},

METHODS: Key indicators were defined (a) among men in the general population: prevalence of sex with a man ever and last year; (b) among MSM: prevalence of heterosexual experiences ever and last year; proportion of male-female transgenders; proportion of sex workers; prevalence of HIV and other STIs, condom use in last sexual encounter; consistent condom use with men last year; never used a condom with a man. With help from key informants, study searches were conducted in Pubmed, LILLACS, institutional databases, conference records and other sources. Methodology and quality of information were assessed, and the best data available for 2003-7 were selected. Indicator estimates from each study were used to propose regional estimate ranges.
RESULTS: A total of 83 new entries were entered into the database in addition to the previous 561, totalling 644. Of these, 107 showing 2003-7 data were selected. Many new studies came from sub-Saharan Africa, portraying hidden HIV epidemics among MSM. The most frequently reported estimate was HIV infection, with high estimate ranges in most of the regions, except for Middle East and North Africa and Eastern Europe. The next most frequently reported was lifetime frequency of heterosexual sex, showing that roughly 50\% of MSM ever had sex with a woman. The small number of newer studies reporting prevalence of "sex with a man in last 12 months" between 2003 and 2007, did not warrant enough new evidence to revise our 2005 size estimates for MSM populations.
CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of new studies with estimates of relevance to understanding sexual behaviour and HIV among MSM were identified, with an encouraging amount of new data coming from sub-Saharan Africa. However, limitations in the quality, utility and comparability of available information persist. At least three measures could be promoted for use in surveillance and academic studies: standardised indicators for MSM studies; standardised operational definitions of, and instructions to describe, variables; and standardised research designs and data gathering strategies. A prerequisite for this all is intense advocacy to ensure a social climate in which research into such matters is prioritised, resources are made available as needed and the human rights of MSM are respected.},

RESULTS: A total of 83 new entries were entered into the database in addition to the previous 561, totalling 644. Of these, 107 showing 2003-7 data were selected. Many new studies came from sub-Saharan Africa, portraying hidden HIV epidemics among MSM. The most frequently reported estimate was HIV infection, with high estimate ranges in most of the regions, except for Middle East and North Africa and Eastern Europe. The next most frequently reported was lifetime frequency of heterosexual sex, showing that roughly 50\% of MSM ever had sex with a woman. The small number of newer studies reporting prevalence of "sex with a man in last 12 months" between 2003 and 2007, did not warrant enough new evidence to revise our 2005 size estimates for MSM populations.
CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of new studies with estimates of relevance to understanding sexual behaviour and HIV among MSM were identified, with an encouraging amount of new data coming from sub-Saharan Africa. However, limitations in the quality, utility and comparability of available information persist. At least three measures could be promoted for use in surveillance and academic studies: standardised indicators for MSM studies; standardised operational definitions of, and instructions to describe, variables; and standardised research designs and data gathering strategies. A prerequisite for this all is intense advocacy to ensure a social climate in which research into such matters is prioritised, resources are made available as needed and the human rights of MSM are respected.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent reports of high HIV infection rates among men who have sex with men (MSM) from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the former Soviet Union (FSU) suggest high levels of HIV transmission among MSM in low- and middle-income countries. To investigate the global epidemic of HIV among MSM and the relationship of MSM outbreaks to general populations, we conducted a comprehensive review of HIV studies among MSM in low- and middle-income countries and performed a meta-analysis of reported MSM and reproductive-age adult HIV prevalence data.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted using systematic methodology. Data regarding HIV prevalence and total sample size was sequestered from each of the studies that met inclusion criteria and aggregate values for each country were calculated. Pooled odds ratio (OR) estimates were stratified by factors including HIV prevalence of the country, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)-classified level of HIV epidemic, geographic region, and whether or not injection drug users (IDUs) played a significant role in given epidemic. Pooled ORs were stratified by prevalence level; very low-prevalence countries had an overall MSM OR of 58.4 (95\% CI 56.3-60.6); low-prevalence countries, 14.4 (95\% CI 13.8-14.9); and medium- to high-prevalence countries, 9.6 (95\% CI 9.0-10.2). Significant differences in ORs for HIV infection among MSM in were seen when comparing low- and middle-income countries; low-income countries had an OR of 7.8 (95\% CI 7.2-8.4), whereas middle-income countries had an OR of 23.4 (95\% CI 22.8-24.0). Stratifying the pooled ORs by whether the country had a substantial component of IDU spread resulted in an OR of 12.8 (95\% CI 12.3-13.4) in countries where IDU transmission was prevalent, and 24.4 (95\% CI 23.7-25.2) where it was not. By region, the OR for MSM in the Americas was 33.3 (95\% CI 32.3-34.2); 18.7 (95\% CI 17.7-19.7) for Asia; 3.8 (95\% CI 3.3-4.3) for Africa; and 1.3 (95\% CI 1.1-1.6) for the low- and middle-income countries of Europe.
CONCLUSIONS: MSM have a markedly greater risk of being infected with HIV compared with general population samples from low- and middle-income countries in the Americas, Asia, and Africa. ORs for HIV infection in MSM are elevated across prevalence levels by country and decrease as general population prevalence increases, but remain 9-fold higher in medium-high prevalence settings. MSM from low- and middle-income countries are in urgent need of prevention and care, and appear to be both understudied and underserved.},

  abstract = {Compared with the application of mathematical models to study human diseases, models that describe animal responses to pathogen challenges are relatively rare. The aim of this review is to explain and show the role of mathematical host-pathogen interaction models in providing underpinning knowledge for improving animal health and sustaining livestock production. Existing host-pathogen interaction models can be assigned to one of three categories: (i) models of the infection and immune system dynamics, (ii) models that describe the impact of pathogen challenge on health, survival and production and (iii) models that consider the co-evolution of host and pathogen. State-of-the-art approaches are presented and discussed for models belonging to the first two categories only, as they concentrate on the host-pathogen dynamics within individuals. Models of the third category fall more into the class of epidemiological models, which deserve a review by themselves. An extensive review of published models reveals a rich spectrum of methodologies and approaches adopted in different modelling studies, and a strong discrepancy between models concerning diseases in animals and models aimed at tackling diseases in humans (most of which belong to the first category), with the latter being generally more sophisticated. The importance of accounting for the impact of infection not only on health but also on production poses a considerable challenge to the study of host-pathogen interactions in livestock. This has led to relatively simplistic representations of host-pathogen interaction in existing models for livestock diseases. Although these have proven appropriate for investigating hypotheses concerning the relationships between health and production traits, they do not provide predictions of an animal's response to pathogen challenge of sufficient accuracy that would be required for the design of appropriate disease control strategies. A synthesis between the modelling methodologies adopted in categories 1 and 2 would therefore be desirable. The progress achieved in mathematical modelling to study immunological processes relevant to human diseases, together with the current advances in the generation and analysis of biological data related to animal diseases, offers a great opportunity to develop a new generation of host-pathogen interaction models that take on a fundamental role in the study and control of disease in livestock.},

Such models are related to and compared with other analytic approaches often used in epidemiology, including regression analysis, causal diagrams, causal mediation analysis, and marginal structural models. Several of these other approaches in fact developed out of the SEM literature. However, SEMs themselves tend to make much stronger assumptions than these other techniques. SEMs estimate more types of effects than do these other techniques, but this comes at the price of additional assumptions. Many of these assumptions have often been ignored and not carefully evaluated when SEMs have been used in practice. In light of the strong assumptions employed by SEMs, the author argues that they should be used principally for the purposes of exploratory analysis and hypothesis generation when a broad range of effects are potentially of interest.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0066167},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In natural populations, individuals are infected more often by several pathogens than by just one. In such a context, pathogens can interact. This interaction could modify the probability of infection by subsequent pathogens. Identifying when pathogen associations correspond to biological interactions is a challenge in cross-sectional studies where the sequence of infection cannot be demonstrated.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we modelled the probability of an individual being infected by one and then another pathogen, using a probabilistic model and maximum likelihood statistics. Our model was developed to apply to cross-sectional data, vector-borne and persistent pathogens, and to take into account confounding factors. Our modelling approach was more powerful than the commonly used Chi-square test of independence. Our model was applied to detect potential interaction between Borrelia afzelii and Bartonella spp. that infected a bank vole population at 11\% and 57\% respectively. No interaction was identified.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The modelling approach we proposed is powerful and can identify the direction of potential interaction. Such an approach can be adapted to other types of pathogens, such as non-persistents. The model can be used to identify when co-occurrence patterns correspond to pathogen interactions, which will contribute to understanding how organism communities are assembled and structured. In the long term, the model's capacity to better identify pathogen interactions will improve understanding of infectious risk.},

  abstract = {In behavioral, biomedical, and psychological studies, structural equation models (SEMs) have been widely used for assessing relationships between latent variables. Regression-type structural models based on parametric functions are often used for such purposes. In many applications, however, parametric SEMs are not adequate to capture subtle patterns in the functions over the entire range of the predictor variable. A different but equally important limitation of traditional parametric SEMs is that they are not designed to handle mixed data types-continuous, count, ordered, and unordered categorical. This paper develops a generalized semiparametric SEM that is able to handle mixed data types and to simultaneously model different functional relationships among latent variables. A structural equation of the proposed SEM is formulated using a series of unspecified smooth functions. The Bayesian P-splines approach and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are developed to estimate the smooth functions and the unknown parameters. Moreover, we examine the relative benefits of semiparametric modeling over parametric modeling using a Bayesian model-comparison statistic, called the complete deviance information criterion (DIC). The performance of the developed methodology is evaluated using a simulation study. To illustrate the method, we used a data set derived from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although several studies have investigated whether CCL3L1 copy number variation (CNV) influences the risk of HIV-1 infection, there are still no clear conclusions. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis using two models to generate a more robust estimate of the association between CCL3L1 CNV and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection.
METHODS: We divided the cases and controls into two parts as individuals with CCL3L1 gene copy number (GCN) above the population specific median copy number (PMN) and individuals with CCL3L1 GCN below PMN, respectively. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) were given for the main analysis. We also conducted stratified analyses by ethnicity, age group and sample size. Relevant literatures were searched through PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge up to March 2010.
RESULTS: In total, 9 studies with 2434 cases and 4029 controls were included. ORs for the main analysis were 1.35 (95\% CI, 1.02-1.78, model: GCN $\leq$ PMN Vs. GCN $>$ PMN) and 1.70 (95\% CI, 1.30-2.23, model: GCN $<$ PMN Vs. GCN $\geq$ PMN), respectively. Either in stratified analysis, statistically significant results can be detected in some subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses indicate that CCL3L1 CNV is associated with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. A lower copy number is associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 infection, while a higher copy number is associated with reduced risk for acquiring HIV-1.},

Discrepant findings may be related to confounding variables, including gender, patterns of alcohol abuse and type of alcohol beverage beyond the amount consumed. Methods: Using a cohort study, differences in HAART effectiveness after 24 weeks of therapy were compared as a function of amount and preference for alcohol, drinking only liquor (LI, n = 55) or only wine or beer (BW, n = 110). Given the critical role of thymus on HAART response, changes in thymus size, CD4s, na\"ive lymphocytes and viral loads were assessed. Results: After HAART, positive increases in both CD4s (+12 cell counts/mm3) and thymus size (+0.7 mm3) were evident in the BW group. In contrast, the LI subgroup exhibited a decline in both parameters (-4 CD4 cells/mm3 and -0.6 mm3 in thymus size). Women in the LI group exhibited significantly lower CD4 (163.4 $\pm$ 46.2) and na\"ive counts (178 $\pm$ 69.5) than LI men (CD4: 281.6 $\pm$ 203, P = 0.05; lymphocytes: 301.4 $\pm$ 198, P = 0.04). In adjusted regression models, the LI compared to the BW subgroup had greater odds of maintaining detectable viral loads (RR = 1.35, 95\% CI 1.04\textendash{}1.75; P = 0.03), increased thymus volumes (RR = 3.8, P = 0.04) and replenished na\"ive cells (RR = 13, P = 0.02). Conclusions: Liquor was associated with thymus deterioration and thus with poorer viro-immune outcomes after HAART. Subtyping participants by alcohol consumption patterns seems to be clinically relevant and needs to be accounted for in future studies.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate evidence for resistance to HIV-1 infection associated with the heterozygous genotype CCR5-+/Delta32 and with the homozygous genotype CCR5-Delta32/Delta32, which results in a nonfunctional CCR5 receptor.
DESIGN: Cohort study of initially HIV-seronegative high-risk individuals from eight different cities. Enrollment data were analyzed to investigate the association of demographic factors and risk behaviors with CCR5 genotypes on the assumption that increased genotype prevalence among persons with histories of longer or more intensive exposure to HIV would indicate HIV resistance associated with that genotype. Longitudinal data were analyzed to investigate the association of HIV seroincidence with CCR5 genotypes. The cohort of 2996 individuals included 1892 men who have sex with men (MSM), 474 male injection drug users (IDUs), 347 women at heterosexual risk, and 283 female IDUs.
MEASUREMENTS: CCR5 genotype, HIV serostatus, demographic factors, and risk behaviors during the 6 months before enrollment, followed by measurement of HIV seroincidence during the subsequent 18 months (for men) and 24 months (for women).
RESULTS: Forty (1.3\%) subjects were homozygous CCR5-Delta32/Delta32 and 387 (12.9\%) were heterozygous CCR5-+/Delta32. All but 1 CCR5-Delta32/Delta32 individuals and 51 CCR5-+/Delta32 individuals were Caucasian. Among 1531 Caucasian MSM, CCR5-+/Delta32 individuals were present more frequently (22.3\%) among those reporting unprotected receptive anal intercourse than among those not reporting this risk (15.9\%) (p =.002), suggesting a selective advantage of the heterozygous genotype. CCR5-+/Delta32 individuals also had a significantly reduced relative risk of HIV seroconversion adjusted for unprotected receptive anal intercourse compared with CCR5-/+ individuals (relative risk = 0.30, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08-0.97). CCR5-Delta32/Delta32 prevalence among Caucasian MSM was significantly associated with age among subjects recruited from high HIV seroprevalence cities (New York City and San Francisco) (odds ratio [OR] for each decade increase in age = 2.57, CI: 1.56-4.21) but not among those recruited from lower HIV prevalence sites (Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Seattle, and Providence/Pawtucket, Rhode Island) (OR = 1.20, CI: 0.75-1.89).
CONCLUSIONS: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses indicated that among high-risk HIV seronegative MSM, CCR5-+/Delta32 and CCR5-Delta32/Delta32 are associated with protection against HIV infection. These findings imply that strategies aimed at reducing susceptibility to HIV infection by blocking CCR5 receptor sites need not seek blockage of all receptor sites to achieve an imperfect but substantial degree of protection.},

  doi = {10.1097/TA.0b013e31824d0f70},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colectomy patients experience a broad set of adverse outcomes. Complications requiring critical care support are common in this group. We hypothesized that as frailty increases, the risk of Clavien class IV and V complications will increase in colectomy patients.
METHODS: Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) participant use files for 2005-2009, we identified patients who underwent laparoscopic and open colectomies by Current Procedural Terminology code. Using the Clavien classification for postoperative complications, we identified NSQIP data points most consistent with Clavien class IV requiring intensive care unit (ICU) care or class V complications (death). We used a modified frailty index with 11 variables based on mapping the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index and existing NSQIP variables. Logistic regression was performed to acuity adjust the findings.
RESULTS: A total of 58,448 colectomies were identified. As frailty index increased from 0 to 0.55, the proportion of those experiencing Clavien class IV or V complications increased from 3.2\% at baseline to 56.3\%. Variables found to be significant by logistic regression (odds ratio) were frailty index (14.4; p = 0.001), open procedure (2.35; p $<$ 0.001), and American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4 (3.2; p = 0.038) or 5 (7.1; p = 0.001) while emergency operation and wound classification 3 or 4 were not.
CONCLUSIONS: Complications requiring ICU care represent a significant morbidity in the colectomy patient population. Frailty index seems to be an important predictor of ICU-level complications and death, and laparoscopy seems to be protective.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: The increasing number of elderly and comorbid patients undergoing surgical procedures raises interest in better identifying patients at increased risk of morbidity and mortality, independent of age. Frailty has been identified as a predictor of surgical complications.
OBJECTIVE: To establish the implications of frailty as a predictor of morbidity and mortality in inpatient otolaryngologic operations.
DESIGN: Retrospective review of medical records.
SETTING: National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) participating hospitals.
PATIENTS: NSQIP participant use files were used to identify 6727 inpatients who underwent operations performed by surgeons specializing in otolaryngology between 2005 and 2010. The study sample was 50.3\% male and 10.2\% African American, with a mean (range) age of 54.7 (16-90) years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A previously described modified frailty index (mFI) was calculated on the basis of NSQIP variables. The effect of increasing frailty on morbidity and mortality was evaluated using univariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression was used to compare mFI with age, ASA, and wound classification. RESULTS The mean (range) mFI was 0.07 (0-0.73). As the mFI increased from 0 (no frailty-associated variables) to 0.45 (5 of 11) or higher, mortality risk increased from 0.2\% to 11.9\%. The risk of Clavien-Dindo grade IV complications increased from 1.2\% to 26.2\%. The risk of all complications increased from 9.5\% to 40.5\%. All results were significant at P $<$\,.001. In a multivariate logistic regression model to predict mortality or serious complication, mFI became the dominant significant predictor.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The mFI is significantly associated with morbidity and mortality in this retrospective survey. Additional study with prospective analysis and external validation is needed. The mFI may provide an improved understanding of preoperative risk, which would facilitate perioperative optimization, risk stratification, and counseling related to outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many definitions of frailty exist, but few have been directly compared. We compared the relationship between a definition of frailty based on a specific phenotype with one based on an index of deficit accumulation.
METHODS: The data come from all 2305 people 70 years old and older who composed the clinical examination cohort of the second wave of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging. We tested convergent validity by correlating the measures with each other and with other health status measures, and analyzed cumulative index distributions in relation to phenotype. To test criterion validity, we evaluated survival (institutionalization and all-cause mortality) by frailty index (FI) score, stratified by the phenotypic definitions as "robust," "pre-frail," and "frail."
RESULTS: The measures correlated moderately well with each other (R=0.65) and with measures of function (phenotypic definition R=0.66; FI R=0.73) but less well with cognition (phenotypic definition R=-0.35; FI R=-0.58). The median FI scores increased from 0.12 for the robust to 0.30 for the pre-frail and 0.44 for the frail. Survival was also lower with increasing frailty, and institutionalization was more common, but within each phenotypic class, there were marked differences in outcomes based on the FI values-e.g., among robust people, the median 5-year survival for those with lower FI values was 85\%, compared with 55\% for those with higher FI values.
CONCLUSION: The phenotypic definition of frailty, which offers ready clinical operationalization, discriminates broad levels of risk. The FI requires additional clinical translation, but allows the risk of adverse outcomes to be defined more precisely.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence and 10-year outcomes of frailty in older adults in relation to deficit accumulation.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: The National Population Health Survey of Canada, with frailty estimated at baseline (1994/95) and mortality follow-up to 2004/05.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults (N=2,740, 60.8\% women) aged 65 to 102 from 10 Canadian provinces. During the 10-year follow-up, 1,208 died.
MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported health information was used to construct a frailty index (Frailty Index) as a proportion of deficits accumulated in individuals. The main outcome measure was mortality.
RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty increased with age in men and women (correlation coefficient=0.955-0.994, P$<$.001). The Frailty Index estimated that 622 (22.7\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=21.0-24.4\%) of the sample was frail. Frailty was more common in women (25.3\%, 95\% CI=23.2-27.5\%) than in men (18.6\%, 95\% CI=15.9-21.3\%). For those aged 85 and older, the Frailty Index identified 39.1\% (95\% CI=31.3-46.9\%) of men as frail, compared with 45.1\% (95\% CI=39.7-50.5\%) of women. Frailty significantly increased the risk of death, with an age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio for the Frailty Index of 1.57 (95\% CI=1.41-1.74).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of frailty increases with age and at any age lessens survival. The Frailty Index approach readily identifies frail people at risk of death, presumably because of its use of multiple health deficits in multidimensional domains.},

DESIGN: Prospective study, the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study.
SETTING: Forty U.S. clinical centers.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty thousand six hundred fifty-seven women aged 65 to 79 at baseline.
MEASUREMENTS: Components of frailty included self-reported muscle weakness/impaired walking, exhaustion, low physical activity, and unintended weight loss between baseline and 3 years of follow-up. Death, hip fractures, ADL disability, and hospitalizations were ascertained during an average of 5.9 years of follow-up.
RESULTS: Baseline frailty was classified in 16.3\% of participants, and incident frailty at 3-years was 14.8\%. Older age, chronic conditions, smoking, and depressive symptom score were positively associated with incident frailty, whereas income, moderate alcohol use, living alone, and self-reported health were inversely associated. Being underweight, overweight, or obese all carried significantly higher risk of frailty than normal weight. Baseline frailty independently predicted risk of death (hazard ratio (HR)=1.71, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=1.48-1.97), hip fracture (HR=1.57, 95\% CI=1.11-2.20), ADL disability (odds ratio (OR)=3.15, 95\% CI=2.47-4.02), and hospitalizations (OR=1.95, 95\% CI=1.72-2.22) after adjustment for demographic characteristics, health behaviors, disability, and comorbid conditions.
CONCLUSION: These results support the robustness of the concept of frailty as a geriatric syndrome that predicts several poor outcomes in older women. Underweight, obesity, smoking, and depressive symptoms are strongly associated with the development of frailty and represent important targets for prevention.},

  abstract = {Background
Accurate prognosis is vital to the initiation of advance care planning particularly in a vulnerable, at risk population such as care home residents. The aim of this paper is to report on the revision and simplification of the MDS Mortality Rating Index (MMRI) for use in clinical practice to predict the probability of death in six months for care home residents.

Methods
The design was a secondary analysis of a US Minimum Data Set (MDS) for long term care residents using regression analysis to identify predictors of mortality within six months.

Results
Using twelve easy to collect items, the probability of mortality within six months was accurately predicted within the MDS database. The items are: admission to the care home within three months; lost weight unintentionally in past three months; renal failure; chronic heart failure; poor appetite; male; dehydrated; short of breath; active cancer diagnosis; age; deteriorated cognitive skills in past three months; activities of daily living score.

Conclusion
A lack of recognition of the proximity of death is often blamed for inappropriate admission to hospital at the end of an older person's life. An accurate prognosis for older adults living in a residential or nursing home can facilitate end of life decision making and planning for preferred place of care at the end of life. The original MMRI was derived and validated from a large database of long term care residents in the USA. However, this simplification of the revised index (MMRI-R) may provide a means for facilitating prognostication and end of life discussions for application outside the USA where the MDS is not in use. Prospective testing is needed to further test the accuracy of the MMRI-R and its application in the UK and other non-MDS settings.},

  abstract = {To better understand the degree to which risk-standardized thirty-day readmission rates may be influenced by social factors, we compared results for hospitals in Missouri under two types of models. The first type of model is currently used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for public reporting of condition-specific hospital readmission rates of Medicare patients. The second type of model is an ``enriched'' version of the first type of model with census tract-level socioeconomic data such as poverty rate, educational attainment, and housing vacancy rate. We found that the inclusion of these factors had a pronounced effect on calculated hospital readmission rates for patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia. Specifically, the models including socioeconomic data narrowed the range of observed variation in readmission rates for the above conditions, in percentage points, from 6.5 to 1.8, 14.0 to 7.4, and 7.4 to 3.7, respectively. Interestingly the average readmission rates for the three conditions did not change significantly between the two types of models. The results of our exploratory analysis suggest that further work to characterize and report the effects of socioeconomic factors on standardized readmission measures may assist efforts to improve care quality and deliver more equitable care on the part of hospitals, payers, and other stakeholders.},

  abstract = {Case mix index (CMI) has become a standard indicator of hospital disease severity in the United States and internationally. However, CMI was designed to calculate hospital payments, not to track disease severity, and is highly dependent on documentation and coding accuracy. The authors evaluated whether CMI varied by characteristics affecting hospitals' disease severity (eg, trauma center or not). The authors also evaluated whether CMI was lower at public hospitals than private hospitals, given the diminished financial resources to support documentation enhancement at public hospitals. CMI data for a 14-year period from a large public database were analyzed longitudinally and cross-sectionally to define the impact of hospital variables on average CMI within and across hospital groups. Between 1996 and 2007, average CMI declined by 0.4\% for public hospitals, while rising significantly for private for-profit (14\%) and nonprofit (6\%) hospitals. After the introduction of the Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) system in 2007, average CMI increased for all 3 hospital types but remained lowest in public vs. private for-profit or nonprofit hospitals (1.05 vs. 1.25 vs. 1.20; P$<$0.0001). By multivariate analysis, teaching hospitals, level 1 trauma centers, and larger hospitals had higher average CMI, consistent with a marker of disease severity, but only for private hospitals. Public hospitals had lower CMI across all subgroups. Although CMI had some characteristics of a disease severity marker, it was lower across all strata for public hospitals. Hence, caution is warranted when using CMI to adjust for disease severity across public vs. private hospitals. (Population Health Management 2014;17:28\textendash{}34)},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Rapid and objective preoperative assessment of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) remains problematic. Preoperative variables correlate with increased morbidity and mortality, yet no easily implemented tool exists to stratify patients. We determined the relationship between our fully implemented frailty-based bedside Risk Analysis Index (RAI) and complications after CEA.
METHODS: Patients undergoing CEA in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database from 2005 to 2011 were included. Variables of frailty RAI were matched to preoperative NSQIP variables, and outcomes including stroke, mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and length of stay were analyzed. We further analyzed patients who were symptomatic and asymptomatic before CEA.
RESULTS: With use of the NSQIP database, 44,832 patients undergoing CEA were analyzed (17,696 [39.5\%] symptomatic; 27,136 [60.5\%] asymptomatic). Increasing frailty RAI score correlated with increasing stroke, death, and MI (P $<$ .0001) as well as with length of stay. RAI demonstrated increasing risk of stroke and death on the basis of risk stratification (low risk [0-10], 2.1\%; high risk [$>$10], 5.0\%). Among patients undergoing CEA, 88\% scored low ($<$10) on the RAI. In symptomatic patients, the risk of stroke and death for patients with a score of $\leq$10 is 2.9\%, whereas if the RAI score is 11 to 15, it is 5.0\%; 16 to 20, 6.9\%; and $>$21, 8.6\%. In asymptomatic patients, the risk of stroke and death for patients with a score of $\leq$10 is 1.6\%, whereas if the RAI score is 11 to 15, it is 2.9\%; 16 to 20, 5.2\%; and $>$21, 6.2\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is a predictor of increased stroke, mortality, MI, and length of stay after CEA. An easily implemented RAI holds the potential to identify a limited subset of patients who are at higher risk for postoperative complications and may not benefit from CEA.},

Readmission rates that are not adjusted for race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status, patient risk factors beyond a hospital's control, may not accurately reflect a hospital's performance. In this study, we examined the extent to which risk-adjusting for race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status affected hospital performance in terms of readmission rates following THA and TKA.
METHODS: We calculated 2 sets of risk-adjusted readmission rates by (1) using the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services standard risk-adjustment algorithm that incorporates patient age, sex, comorbidities, and hospital effects and (2) adding race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status to the model. Using data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, 2011 State Inpatient Databases, we compared the relative performances of 1,194 hospitals across the 2 methods.
RESULTS: Addition of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status to the risk-adjustment algorithm resulted in (1) little or no change in the risk-adjusted readmission rates at nearly all hospitals; (2) no change in the designation of the readmission rate as better, worse, or not different from the population mean at $>$99\% of the hospitals; and (3) no change in the excess readmission ratio at $>$97\% of the hospitals.
CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status in the risk-adjustment algorithm led to a relative-performance change in readmission rates following THA and TKA at $<$3\% of the hospitals. We believe that policymakers and payers should consider this result when deciding whether to include race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status in risk-adjusted THA and TKA readmission rates used for hospital accountability, payment, and public reporting.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As the population ages, increasing numbers of older adults are undergoing surgery. Frailty is prevalent in older adults and may be a better predictor of post-operative morbidity and mortality than chronological age. The aim of this review was to examine the impact of frailty on adverse outcomes in the 'older old' and 'oldest old' surgical patients.
METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken. Electronic databases from 2010 to 2015 were searched to identify articles which evaluated the relationship between frailty and post-operative outcomes in surgical populations with a mean age of 75 and older. Articles were excluded if they were in non-English languages or if frailty was measured using a single marker only. Demographic data, type of surgery performed, frailty measure and impact of frailty on adverse outcomes were extracted from the selected studies. Quality of the studies and risk of bias was assessed by the Epidemiological Appraisal Instrument.
RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were selected for the review and they were assessed as medium to high quality. The mean age ranged from 75 to 87~years, and included patients undergoing cardiac, oncological, general, vascular and hip fracture surgeries. There were 21 different instruments used to measure frailty. Regardless of how frailty was measured, the strongest evidence in terms of numbers of studies, consistency of results and study quality was for associations between frailty and increased mortality at 30~days, 90~days and one year follow-up, post-operative complications and length of stay. A small number of studies reported on discharge to institutional care, functional decline and lower quality of life after surgery, and also found a significant association with frailty.
CONCLUSION: There was strong evidence that frailty in older-old and oldest-old surgical patients predicts post-operative mortality, complications, and prolonged length of stay. Frailty assessment may be a valuable tool in peri-operative assessment. It is possible that different frailty tools are best suited for different acuity and type of surgical patients. The association between frailty and return to pre-morbid function, discharge destination, and quality of life after surgery warrants further research.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The inflammatory or stress response to injury has evolved to ensure survival. This review will examine this response in otherwise healthy patients. Additionally, the impact of several common comorbid conditions on the inflammatory response will be considered. What will become evident is that the stress response may be exaggerated in some conditions and suppressed in others. Rapid identification of both an abnormal response and its cause will allow clinicians to maximize a patient's healing potential.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent work has shown that an altered inflammatory response has marked effects on both immune competence and the endocrine system. Investigations are ongoing to delineate the mechanism of lymphocyte dysfunction. With regard to critical care endocrinopathies, the effects of insulin and hyperglycemia on inflammation and wound healing are being investigated.
SUMMARY: An understanding of the stress response will aid the clinician in preparing for expected responses, recognizing and perhaps correcting deviations from the norm and accounting for potential complications that arise in the face of preexisting disease. Deviations from the normal time course may represent the effects of preexisting medical illness, treatment or postoperative/injury complications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services (CMS) and Veterans Health Administration (VA) will report 30-day stroke readmission rates as a measure of hospital quality. A national debate on whether social risk factors should be included in models developed for hospital profiling is ongoing.
OBJECTIVE: To compare a CMS-based model of 30-day readmission with a more comprehensive model that includes measures of social risk (such as homelessness) or clinical factors (such as stroke severity and functional status).
DESIGN: Data from a retrospective cohort study were used to develop a CMS-based 30-day readmission model that included age and comorbid conditions based on codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (model 1). This model was then compared with one that included administrative social risk factors (model 2). Finally, the CMS model (model 1) was compared with a model that included social risk and clinical factors from chart review (model 3). These 3 models were used to rank hospitals by 30-day risk-standardized readmission rates and examine facility rankings among the models.
SETTING: Hospitals in the VA.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients hospitalized with stroke in 2007.
MEASUREMENTS: 30-day readmission rates.
RESULTS: The 30-day readmission rate was 12.8\%. The c-statistics for the 3 models were 0.636, 0.646, and 0.661, respectively. All hospitals were classified as performing "as expected" using all 3 models (that is, performance did not differ from the VA national average); therefore, the addition of detailed clinical information or social risk factors did not alter assessment of facility performance.
LIMITATION: A predominantly male veteran cohort limits the generalizability of these findings.
CONCLUSION: In the VA, more comprehensive models that included social risk and clinical factors did not affect hospital comparisons based on 30-day readmission rates.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether black patients have higher odds of readmission than white patients and whether these disparities are related to where black patients receive care.
DESIGN: Using national Medicare data, we examined 30-day readmissions after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and pneumonia. We categorized hospitals in the top decile of proportion of black patients as minority-serving. We determined the odds of readmission for black patients compared with white patients at minority-serving vs non-minority-serving hospitals.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Medicare Provider Analysis Review files of more than 3.1 million Medicare fee-for-service recipients who were discharged from US hospitals in 2006-2008.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Risk-adjusted odds of 30-day readmission.
RESULTS: Overall, black patients had higher readmission rates than white patients (24.8\% vs 22.6\%, odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.14; P $<$ .001); patients from minority-serving hospitals had higher readmission rates than those from non-minority-serving hospitals (25.5\% vs 22.0\%, OR, 1.23; 95\% CI, 1.20-1.27; P $<$ .001). Among patients with acute MI and using white patients from non-minority-serving hospitals as the reference group (readmission rate 20.9\%), black patients from minority-serving hospitals had the highest readmission rate (26.4\%; OR, 1.35; 95\% CI, 1.28-1.42), while white patients from minority-serving hospitals had a 24.6\% readmission rate (OR, 1.23; 95\% CI, 1.18-1.29) and black patients from non-minority-serving hospitals had a 23.3\% readmission rate (OR, 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.16-1.23; P $<$ .001 for each); patterns were similar for CHF and pneumonia. The results were unchanged after adjusting for hospital characteristics including markers of caring for poor patients.
CONCLUSION: Among elderly Medicare recipients, black patients were more likely to be readmitted after hospitalization for 3 common conditions, a gap that was related to both race and to the site where care was received.},

  abstract = {Objective
To evaluate how limited English proficiency affects treatment outcome in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients treated with curative intent radiation therapy (RT).

Methods
From 2004 to 2010, 131 patients with HNC underwent RT. Patient's self-reported primary language and race/ethnicity were obtained at hospital registration. English proficiency was categorized as being English proficient (EP) or limited English proficient (LEP). Race/ethnicity was categorized as white, black and other (Hispanics and Asians). Patients were evaluated for locoregional (LRC), distant control (DC), overall (OS) and disease-free (DFS) survival.

Results
Fewer LEP patients (60.0\%) underwent chemoradiation compared to EP (83.8\%), P = 0.028. The three-year actuarial LRC for EP and LEP patients was 82.2\% and 58.3\%, respectively, P = 0.038. LEP patients had an increased risk of locoregional failure on univariate Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio, HR 2.4, 95\% CI, 1.0\textendash{}5.8). No differences by English proficiency were seen for DC, OS and DFS. Race/ethnicity was not associated LRC, DC, OS and DFS.

Conclusion
Inferior locoregional control was observed in LEP patients receiving RT for HNC. Potential health disparities as a result of limited English proficiency require further investigation.

Practice implications
Patient education, use of culturally sensitive interpreter and patient navigation services, and improved patient compliance should be considered in head and neck cancer patients receiving complex multidisciplinary care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently, 24\% of all deaths nationally occur in nursing homes making this an important focus of care. However, many residents are not identified as dying and thus do not receive appropriate care in the last weeks and months of life. The aim of our study was to develop and validate a predictive model of 6-month mortality risk using functional, emotional, cognitive, and disease variables found in the Minimum Data Set.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study developed and validated a clinical prediction model using stepwise logistic regression analysis. Our study sample included all Missouri long-term-care residents (43,510) who had a full Minimum Data Set assessment transmitted to the Federal database in calendar year 1999. Death was confirmed by death certificate data.
RESULTS: The validated predictive model with a c-statistic of.75 included the following predictors: a) demographics (age and male sex); b) diseases (cancer, congestive heart failure, renal failure, and dementia/Alzheimer's disease); c) clinical signs and symptoms (shortness of breath, deteriorating condition, weight loss, poor appetite, dehydration, increasing number of activities of daily living requiring assistance, and poor score on the cognitive performance scale); and d) adverse events (recent admission to the nursing home). A simple point system derived from the regression equation can be totaled to aid in predicting mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: A reasonably accurate, validated model has been produced, with clinical application through a scored point system, to assist clinicians, residents, and family members in defining good goals of care around end-of-life care.},

We are particularly interested in the use of longitudinal information as a way of improving the outcome side of prognostic models. This involves optimally characterizing individuals' outcome status, classifying them, and validating the formulated prediction targets. None of these tasks are straightforward, which may explain why longitudinal prediction targets are not commonly used in practice despite their compelling benefits. As a way of improving this situation, we explore the joint use of empirical model fitting, clinical insights, and cross-validation based on how well formulated targets are predicted by clinically relevant baseline characteristics (antecedent validators). The idea here is that all these methods are imperfect but can be used together to triangulate valid prediction targets.

The study population was subdivided into two groups based on the nature of procedures performed: complex procedures (inpatient) and simple procedures (outpatient). Risk Analysis Index score was calculated using preoperative NSQIP variables to determine preoperative frailty. Major postoperative morbidities (pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal and infectious), mortality, return to operating room, discharge destination and readmission to the hospital were examined.ResultsThe study identified 42,715 patients who underwent urological procedures, 25,693 complex and 17,022 simple procedures. Mean RAI score (range) was 7.75 (0\textendash{}53). The majority of patients scored low on the RAI (90.57 \% with RAI $<$ 10). As the RAI score increased, there was a significant increase in postoperative complication and mortality rate (both p $<$ 0.0001). Similarly, the rate of return to operating room and hospital readmission rate increased as RAI increased (both p $<$ 0.0001). Additionally, rate of discharge to home decreased. Interestingly, mortality rate in patients with high RAI did not differ comparing simple to complex procedures (p = 0.90), whereas complications were significantly greater in the complex operation (p = 0.01).ConclusionsIncrease in frailty, as measured by RAI score, is associated with increased postoperative complications and mortality. RAI may allow for rapid identification and counseling of patients who are at high risk of adverse perioperative outcomes.},

  abstract = {Health care disparities (differential access, care, and outcomes owing to factors such as race/ethnicity) are widely established. Compared with other groups, African American individuals have an increased mortality risk across multiple surgical procedures. Gender, sexual orientation, age, and geographic disparities are also well documented. Further research is needed to mitigate these inequities. To do so, the American College of Surgeons and the National Institutes of Health-National Institute of Minority Health and Disparities convened a research summit to develop a national surgical disparities research agenda and funding priorities. Sixty leading researchers and clinicians gathered in May 2015 for a 2-day summit. First, literature on surgical disparities was presented within 5 themes: (1) clinician, (2) patient, (3) systemic/access, (4) clinical quality, and (5) postoperative care and rehabilitation-related factors. These themes were identified via an exhaustive preconference literature review and guided the summit and its interactive consensus-building exercises. After individual thematic presentations, attendees contributed research priorities for each theme. Suggestions were collated, refined, and prioritized during the latter half of the summit. Breakout sessions yielded 3 to 5 top research priorities by theme. Overall priorities, regardless of theme, included improving patient-clinician communication, fostering engagement and community outreach by using technology, improving care at facilities with a higher proportion of minority patients, evaluating the longer-term effect of acute intervention and rehabilitation support, and improving patient centeredness by identifying expectations for recovery. The National Institutes of Health and American College of Surgeons Summit on Surgical Disparities Research succeeded in identifying a comprehensive research agenda. Future research and funding priorities should prioritize patients' care perspectives, workforce diversification and training, and systematic evaluation of health technologies to reduce surgical disparities.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess whether differences in readmission rates between safety-net hospitals (SNH) and non-SNHs are due to differences in hospital quality, and to compare the results of hospital profiling with and without SES adjustment.
BACKGROUND: In response to concerns that quality measures unfairly penalizes SNH, NQF recently recommended that performance measures adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) when SES is a risk factor for poor patient outcomes.
METHODS: Multivariate regression was used to examine the association between SNH status and 30-day readmission after major surgery. The results of hospital profiling with and without SES adjustment were compared using the CMS Hospital Compare and the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) methodologies.
RESULTS: Adjusting for patient risk and SES, patients admitted to SNHs were not more likely to be readmitted compared with patients in in non-SNHs (AOR 1.08; 95\% CI:0.95-1.23; P = 0.23). The results of hospital profiling based on Hospital Compare were nearly identical with and without SES adjustment (ICC 0.99, $\kappa$ 0.96). Using the HRRP threshold approach, 61\% of SNHs were assigned to the penalty group versus 50\% of non-SNHs. After adjusting for SES, 51\% of SNHs were assigned to the penalty group.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in surgery readmissions between SNHs and non-SNHs are due to differences in the patient case mix of low-SES patients, and not due to differences in quality. Adjusting readmission measures for SES leads to changes in hospital ranking using the HRRP threshold approach, but not using the CMS Hospital Compare methodology. CMS should consider either adjusting for the effects of SES when calculating readmission thresholds for HRRP, or replace it with the approach used in Hospital Compare.},

  shorttitle = {Risk Stratification in Heart Surgery},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Risk scores have become an important tool in patient assessment, as age, severity of heart disease, and comorbidity in patients undergoing heart surgery have considerably increased. Various risk scores have been developed to predict mortality after heart surgery. However, there are significant differences between scores with regard to score design and the initial patient population on which score development was based. It was the purpose of our study to compare six commonly used risk scores with regard to their validity in our patient population.
METHODS: Between September 1, 1998 and February 28, 1999, all adult patients undergoing heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass in our institution were preoperatively scored using the initial Parsonnet, Cleveland Clinic, French, Euro, Pons, and Ontario Province Risk (OPR) scores. Postoperatively, we registered 30-day mortality, use of mechanical assist devices, renal failure requiring hemodialysis or hemofiltration, stroke, myocardial infarction, and duration of ventilation and intensive care stay. Score validity was assessed by calculating the area under the ROC curve. Odds ratios were calculated to investigate the predictive relevance of risk factors.
RESULTS: Follow-up was able to be completed in 504 prospectively scored patients. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis for mortality showed the best predictive value for the Euro score. Predictive values for morbidity were considerably lower than predictive values for mortality in all of the investigated score systems. For most risk factors, odds ratios for mortality were substantially different from ratios for morbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: Among the investigated scores, the Euro score yielded the highest predictive value in our patient population. For most risk factors, predictive values for morbidity were substantially different from predictive values for mortality. Therefore, development of specific morbidity risk scores may improve prediction of outcome and hospital cost. Due to the heterogeneity of morbidity events, future score systems may have to generate separate predictions for mortality and major morbidity events.},

  volume = {56},
  issn = {1079-5006},
  shorttitle = {Frailty in Older Adults},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty is considered highly prevalent in old age and to confer high risk for falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality. Frailty has been considered synonymous with disability, comorbidity, and other characteristics, but it is recognized that it may have a biologic basis and be a distinct clinical syndrome. A standardized definition has not yet been established.
METHODS: To develop and operationalize a phenotype of frailty in older adults and assess concurrent and predictive validity, the study used data from the Cardiovascular Health Study. Participants were 5,317 men and women 65 years and older (4,735 from an original cohort recruited in 1989-90 and 582 from an African American cohort recruited in 1992-93). Both cohorts received almost identical baseline evaluations and 7 and 4 years of follow-up, respectively, with annual examinations and surveillance for outcomes including incident disease, hospitalization, falls, disability, and mortality.
RESULTS: Frailty was defined as a clinical syndrome in which three or more of the following criteria were present: unintentional weight loss (10 lbs in past year), self-reported exhaustion, weakness (grip strength), slow walking speed, and low physical activity. The overall prevalence of frailty in this community-dwelling population was 6.9\%; it increased with age and was greater in women than men. Four-year incidence was 7.2\%. Frailty was associated with being African American, having lower education and income, poorer health, and having higher rates of comorbid chronic diseases and disability. There was overlap, but not concordance, in the cooccurrence of frailty, comorbidity, and disability. This frailty phenotype was independently predictive (over 3 years) of incident falls, worsening mobility or ADL disability, hospitalization, and death, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.82 to 4.46, unadjusted, and 1.29-2.24, adjusted for a number of health, disease, and social characteristics predictive of 5-year mortality. Intermediate frailty status, as indicated by the presence of one or two criteria, showed intermediate risk of these outcomes as well as increased risk of becoming frail over 3-4 years of follow-up (odds ratios for incident frailty = 4.51 unadjusted and 2.63 adjusted for covariates, compared to those with no frailty criteria at baseline).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a potential standardized definition for frailty in community-dwelling older adults and offers concurrent and predictive validity for the definition. It also finds that there is an intermediate stage identifying those at high risk of frailty. Finally, it provides evidence that frailty is not synonymous with either comorbidity or disability, but comorbidity is an etiologic risk factor for, and disability is an outcome of, frailty. This provides a potential basis for clinical assessment for those who are frail or at risk, and for future research to develop interventions for frailty based on a standardized ascertainment of frailty.},

  title = {An Overview of Reviews Evaluating the Effectiveness of Financial Incentives in Changing Healthcare Professional Behaviours and Patient Outcomes},
  issn = {1469-493X},
  doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD009255},
  abstract = {Background
There is considerable interest in the effectiveness of financial incentives in the delivery of health care. Incentives may be used in an attempt to increase the use of evidence-based treatments among healthcare professionals or to stimulate health professionals to change their clinical behaviour with respect to preventive, diagnostic and treatment decisions, or both. Financial incentives are an extrinsic source of motivation and exist when an individual can expect a monetary transfer which is made conditional on acting in a particular way. Since there are numerous reviews performed within the healthcare area describing the effects of various types of financial incentives, it is important to summarise the effectiveness of these in an overview to discern which are most effective in changing health professionals' behaviour and patient outcomes.

Objectives
To conduct an overview of systematic reviews that evaluates the impact of financial incentives on healthcare professional behaviour and patient outcomes.

Methods
We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) (The Cochrane Library); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE); TRIP; MEDLINE; EMBASE; Science Citation Index; Social Science Citation Index; NHS EED; HEED; EconLit; and Program in Policy Decision-Making (PPd) (from their inception dates up to January 2010). We searched the reference lists of all included reviews and carried out a citation search of those papers which cited studies included in the review. We included both Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), interrupted time series (ITSs) and controlled before and after studies (CBAs) that evaluated the effects of financial incentives on professional practice and patient outcomes, and that reported numerical results of the included individual studies. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of each review according to the AMSTAR criteria. We included systematic reviews of studies evaluating the effectiveness of any type of financial incentive. We grouped financial incentives into five groups: payment for working for a specified time period; payment for each service, episode or visit; payment for providing care for a patient or specific population; payment for providing a pre-specified level or providing a change in activity or quality of care; and mixed or other systems. We summarised data using vote counting.

Main results
We identified four reviews reporting on 32 studies. Two reviews scored 7 on the AMSTAR criteria (moderate, score 5 to 7, quality) and two scored 9 (high, score 8 to 11, quality). The reported quality of the included studies was, by a variety of methods, low to moderate. Payment for working for a specified time period was generally ineffective, improving 3/11 outcomes from one study reported in one review. Payment for each service, episode or visit was generally effective, improving 7/10 outcomes from five studies reported in three reviews; payment for providing care for a patient or specific population was generally effective, improving 48/69 outcomes from 13 studies reported in two reviews; payment for providing a pre-specified level or providing a change in activity or quality of care was generally effective, improving 17/20 reported outcomes from 10 studies reported in two reviews; and mixed and other systems were of mixed effectiveness, improving 20/31 reported outcomes from seven studies reported in three reviews. When looking at the effect of financial incentives overall across categories of outcomes, they were of mixed effectiveness on consultation or visit rates (improving 10/17 outcomes from three studies in two reviews); generally effective in improving processes of care (improving 41/57 outcomes from 19 studies in three reviews); generally effective in improving referrals and admissions (improving 11/16 outcomes from 11 studies in four reviews); generally ineffective in improving compliance with guidelines outcomes (improving 5/17 outcomes from five studies in two reviews); and generally effective in improving prescribing costs outcomes (improving 28/34 outcomes from 10 studies in one review).

Authors' conclusions
Financial incentives may be effective in changing healthcare professional practice. The evidence has serious methodological limitations and is also very limited in its completeness and generalisability. We found no evidence from reviews that examined the effect of financial incentives on patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background
An individual's socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with health outcomes and mortality, yet it is unknown whether accounting for SES can improve risk-adjustment models for 30-day outcomes among Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services (CMS) beneficiaries hospitalized with heart failure (HF).

Methods and Results
We linked clinical data on hospitalized HF patients in the Get With The Guidelines\textregistered{}-HF\texttrademark{} database (01/2005\textendash{}12/2011) with CMS claims and county-level SES data from the 2012 Area Health Resources Files. We compared the discriminatory capabilities of multivariable models that adjusted for SES, patient, and/or hospital characteristics to determine whether county-level SES data improved prediction or changed hospital rankings for 30-day all-cause mortality and rehospitalization. After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, median household income (per \$5,000 increase) was inversely associated with odds of 30-day mortality (OR 0.97, 95\% CI 0.95\textendash{}1.00, p=0.032), and the percentage of persons with at least a high school diploma (per 5 unit increase) was associated with lower odds of 30-day rehospitalization (OR 0.95, 95\% CI 0.91\textendash{}0.99).After adjustment for county-level SES data, relative to whites, Hispanic ethnicity (OR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.58, 0.83) and black race (OR 0.57, 95\% CI: 0.50\textendash{}0.65) remained significantly associated with lower 30-day mortality, but had similar 30-day rehospitalization. County-level SES did not improve risk adjustment or change hospital rankings for 30-day mortality or rehospitalization.

Conclusions
County-level SES data are modestly associated with 30-day outcomes for CMS beneficiaries hospitalized with HF, but do not improve risk adjustment models based on patient characteristics alone.},

One key driver of population aging is ongoing increases in life expectancy. Average U.S. life expectancy was 67 years for males and 73 years for females five decades ago; the averages are now 76 and 81, respectively. It has long been the case that better-educated, higher-income people enjoy longer life expectancies than less-educated, lower-income people. The causes include early life conditions, behavioral factors (such as nutrition, exercise, and smoking behaviors), stress, and access to health care services, all of which can vary across education and income. Our major entitlement programs \textendash{} Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and Supplemental Security Income \textendash{} have come to deliver disproportionately larger lifetime benefits to higher-income people because, on average, they are increasingly collecting those benefits over more years than others. This report studies the impact the growing gap in life expectancy has on the present value of lifetime benefits that people with higher or lower earnings will receive from major entitlement programs. The analysis presented in The Growing Gap in Life Expectancy by Income goes beyond an examination of the existing literature by providing the first comprehensive estimates of how lifetime benefits are affected by the changing distribution of life expectancy. The report also explores, from a lifetime benefit perspective, how the growing gap in longevity affects traditional policy analyses of reforms to the nation's leading entitlement programs. This in-depth analysis of the economic impacts of the longevity gap will inform debate and assist decision makers, economists, and researchers.},

Recent legislation, such as the Affordable Care Act and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA), solidified the role of value-based payment in Medicare. Many private insurers are following Medicare's lead. Much of the policy attention has been on programs such as accountable care organizations and bundled payments; yet, value-based purchasing (VBP) or pay-for-performance, defined as providers being paid fee-for-service with payment adjustments up or down based on value metrics, remains a core element of value payment in MACRA and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future. This review article summarizes the current state of VBP programs and provides analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for the future. Multiple inpatient and outpatient VBP programs have been implemented and evaluated, with the impact of those programs being marginal. Opportunities to enhance the performance of VBP programs include improving the quality measurement science, strengthening both the size and design of incentives, reducing health disparities, establishing broad outcome measurement, choosing appropriate comparison targets, and determining the optimal role of VBP relative to alternative payment models. VBP programs will play a significant role in healthcare delivery for years to come, and they serve as an opportunity for providers to build the infrastructure needed for value-oriented care.},

We examined whether the inclusion of a SES measure in 30-day congestive heart failure (CHF) readmission models changed hospital risk standardized readmission rates (RSRR) in New York City (NYC) hospitals.

Methods and Results
Using a Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services (CMS)-like model we estimated 30-day hospital-level RSRR by adjusting for age, gender and comorbid conditions. Next, we examined how hospital RSRRs changed relative to the New York City mean with inclusion of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) validated SES index score. In a secondary analysis, we examined whether inclusion of the AHRQ SES Index score in 30-day readmission models disproportionately impacted the RSRR of minority-serving hospitals., Higher AHRQ SES scores, indicators of higher socioeconomic status, were associated with lower odds, 0.99, of 30-day readmission (p$<$ 0.019). The addition of the AHRQ SES index did not change the model's C statistic (0.63). After adjustment for the AHRQ SES index, one hospital changed status from ``worse than the NYC average'' to ``no different than the NYC average''. After adjustment for the AHRQ SES index, one NYC minority-serving hospital was re-classified from ``worse'' to ``no different than average''.

Conclusions
While patients with higher SES were less likely to be admitted, the impact of SES on readmission was very small. In NYC, inclusion of the AHRQ SES score in a CMS based model did not impact hospital-level profiling based on 30-day readmission.},

Our results demonstrate that hospitals caring for large proportions of patients of low socioeconomic status have readmission rates similar to those of other hospitals. Moreover, readmission rates calculated with and without adjustment for patients' socioeconomic status are highly correlated. Readmission rates of hospitals caring for patients of low socioeconomic status changed by approximately 0.1~percent with adjustment for patients' socioeconomic status, and only 3-4~percent fewer such hospitals reached the threshold for payment penalty in Medicare's HRRP.

  abstract = {Background.
Frailty assessment provides a means of identifying older adults most vulnerable to adverse outcomes. Attention to frailty in clinical practice is more likely with better understanding of its prevalence and associations with patient characteristics. We sought to provide national estimates of frailty in older people.

Methods.
A popular, validated frailty phenotype proposed by Fried and colleagues was applied to 7,439 participants in the 2011 baseline of the National Health and Aging Trends Study, a national longitudinal study of persons aged 65 and older. All measures drew on a 2-hour in-person interview. Weighted estimates of frailty prevalence were obtained.

Results.
Fifteen percent (95\% CI: 14\%, 16\%) of the older non-nursing home population is frail, and 45\% is prefrail (95\% CI: 44\%, 47\%). Frailty is more prevalent at older ages, among women, racial and ethnic minorities, those in supportive residential settings, and persons of lower income. Independently of these characteristics, frailty prevalence varies substantially across geographic regions. Chronic disease and disability prevalence increase steeply with frailty. Among the frail, 42\% were hospitalized in the previous year, compared to 22\% of the prefrail and 11\% of persons considered robust. Hip, back, and heart surgery in the last year were associated with frailty. Over half of frail persons had a fall in the previous year.

Conclusions.
Our findings support the importance of frailty in late-life health etiology and potential value of frailty as a marker of risk for adverse health outcomes and as a means of identifying opportunities for intervention in clinical practice and public health policy.},

  abstract = {Importance: As the US population ages, the number of operations performed on elderly patients will likely increase. Frailty predicts postoperative mortality and morbidity more than age alone, thus presenting opportunities to identify the highest-risk surgical patients and improve their outcomes.
Objective: To examine the effect of the Frailty Screening Initiative (FSI) on mortality and complications by comparing the surgical outcomes of a cohort of surgical patients treated before and after implementation of the FSI.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-site, facility-wide, prospective cohort quality improvement project studied all 9153 patients from a level 1b Veterans Affairs medical center who presented for major, elective, noncardiac surgery from October 1, 2007, to July 1, 2014.
Interventions: Assessment of preoperative frailty in all patients scheduled for elective surgery began in July 2011. Frailty was assessed with the Risk Analysis Index (RAI), and the records of all frail patients (RAI score, $\geq$21) were flagged for administrative review by the chief of surgery (or designee) before the scheduled operation. On the basis of this review, clinicians from surgery, anesthesia, critical care, and palliative care were notified of the patient's frailty and associated surgical risks; if indicated, perioperative plans were modified based on team input.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Postoperative mortality at 30, 180, and 365 days.
Results: From October 1, 2007, to July 1, 2014, a total of 9153 patients underwent surgery (mean [SD] age, 60.3 [13.5] years; female, 653 [7.1\%]; and white, 7096 [79.8\%]). Overall 30-day mortality decreased from 1.6\% (84 of 5275 patients) to 0.7\% (26 of 3878 patients, P\,$<$\,.001) after FSI implementation. Improvement was greatest among frail patients (12.2\% [24 of 197 patients] to 3.8\% [16 of 424 patients], P\,$<$\,.001), although mortality rates also decreased among the robust patients (1.2\% [60 of 5078 patients] to 0.3\% [10 of 3454 patients], P\,$<$\,.001). The magnitude of improvement among frail patients increased at 180 (23.9\% [47 of 197 patients] to 7.7\% [30 of 389 patients], P\,$<$\,.001) and 365 days (34.5\% [68 of 197 patients] to 11.7\% [36 of 309 patients], P\,$<$\,.001). Multivariable models revealed improved survival after FSI implementation, controlling for age, frailty, and predicted mortality (adjusted odds ratio for 180-day survival, 2.87; 95\% CI, 1.98-4.16).
Conclusions and Relevance: Implementation of the FSI was associated with reduced mortality, suggesting the feasibility of widespread screening of patients preoperatively to identify frailty and the efficacy of system-level initiatives aimed at improving their surgical outcomes. Additional investigation is required to establish a causal connection.},

  abstract = {Importance: Growing consensus suggests that frailty-associated risks should inform shared surgical decision making. However, it is not clear how best to screen for frailty in preoperative surgical populations.
Objective: To develop and validate the Risk Analysis Index (RAI), a 14-item instrument used to measure surgical frailty. It can be calculated prospectively (RAI-C), using a clinical questionnaire, or retrospectively (RAI-A), using variables from the surgical quality improvement databases (Veterans Affairs or American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Projects).
Design, Setting, and Participants: Single-site, prospective cohort from July 2011 to September 2015 at the Veterans Affairs Nebraska-Western Iowa Heath Care System, a Level 1b Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The study included all patients presenting to the medical center for elective surgery.
Exposures: We assessed the RAI-C for all patients scheduled for surgery, linking these scores to administrative and quality improvement data to calculate the RAI-A and the modified Frailty Index.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Receiver operator characteristics and C statistics for each measure predicting postoperative mortality and morbidity.
Results: Of the participants, the mean (SD) age was 60.7 (13.9) years and 249 participants (3.6\%) were women. We assessed the RAI-C 10 698 times, from which we linked 6856 unique patients to mortality data. The C statistic predicting 180-day mortality for the RAI-C was 0.772. Of these 6856 unique patients, we linked 2785 to local Veterans Affairs Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Projects data and calculated the C statistic for both the RAI-A (0.823) and RAI-C (0.824), along with the correlation between the 2 scores (r\,=\,0.478; P\,$<$\,.001). Of these 2785 patients, there were sufficient data to calculate the modified Frailty Index for 1021, in which the C statistics were 0.865 (RAI-A), 0.797 (RAI-C), and 0.811 (modified Frailty Index). The correlation between the RAI-A and RAI-C was 0.547, and the correlations of the modified Frailty Index to the RAI-A and RAI-C were 0.301 and 0.269, respectively (all P\,$<$\,.001). A cutoff of RAI-C of at least 21 classified 18.3\% patients as "frail" with a sensitivity of 0.50 and specificity of 0.82, whereas the RAI-A was less sensitive (0.25) and more specific (0.97), classifying only 3.7\% as "frail."
Conclusions and Relevance: The RAI-C and RAI-A represent effective tools for measuring frailty in surgical populations with predictive ability on par with other frailty tools. Moderate correlation between the measures suggests convergent validity. The RAI-C offers the advantage of prospective, preoperative assessment that is proved feasible for large-scale screening in clinical practice. However, further efforts should be directed at determining the optimal components of preoperative frailty assessment.},

Under the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP), hospitals face penalties of up to 3\% of base operating payment from Medicare, the federally funded health insurance system for people aged over 65. Penalties totalled \$428 million in 2015,1 and similar policies are in place in Denmark, Germany and England.2

HRRP aimed to `reward hospitals that are successful in reducing avoidable readmissions'3 and indeed Medicare has seen a decline in 30-day, all-cause readmission rates since the policy was introduced in 2012.4 More specific declines have been observed for the three conditions initially targeted, namely acute myocardial infarction, heart failure and pneumonia (figure 1).1 ,5 The HRRP was expanded to cover chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty from 2015.

While no study has been able to test causality against a counterfactual, on the face of it HRRP has contributed to a sustained focus on readmissions and potentially, improved patient care nationally. But what aspects of quality do readmission rates measure? And what are we to make of the findings reported in this issue of BMJ Quality and Safety ,6 which indicate that, like other pay-for-performance programmes, readmission penalties have disproportionately affected safety-net hospitals (ie, hospitals that serve a high number of patients of lower socioeconomic status (SES), often uninsured).

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE
The need for integrating palliative care into surgical services has been established within the surgical literature. The ability to effectively screen, obtain an appropriately timed consultation, and determine the effect of consultation remains problematic.

OBJECTIVE
To examine surgical palliative care consultations over time and their relationship to the initiation and implementation of a systemwide frailty-screening program.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
We reviewed all surgical palliative care consultations performed between January 1, 2006, and August 31, 2013, and abstracted the referring service (medicine/surgery), date of surgery (if any), date of death (if any), and all variables required to calculate a frailty score using the risk analysis index. We examined changes in mortality and referral patterns before and after implementation of the frailty-screening program using multivariable logistic regression.

EXPOSURES
Surgical palliative care consultations, including frailty screening.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
The primary study outcomes were 30-, 180-, and 360-day mortality.

RESULTS
From 2006 to 2013, a total of 310 palliative care consultations were ordered for surgical patients: 160 before initiation of frailty screening (January 1, 2011) and 150 after initiation of the program. The groups had similar demographics, comorbidities, and frailty scores. After initiation, we observed dramatically decreased mortality at 30, 180, and 360 days (21.3\% vs 31.9\%, 44.0\% vs 70.6\%, and 66.0\% vs 78.8\%, respectively; all P $<$ .05). This coincided with an increased rate of palliative care consultations from 32 per year to 56 per year. After initiation of the program, consultations were more likely to be requested by surgeons (56.7\% vs 24.4\%; P $<$ .05) and were more likely to occur before the index operation (52.0\% vs 26.3\%; P $<$ .05). Implementation of the screening program was associated with a 33\% reduction in 180-day mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95\% CI, 0.22\textendash{}0.62; P $<$ .001) even after controlling for age, frailty, and whether the patients had surgery. Modeled mortality was also reduced when the palliative care consultation was ordered by a surgeon (OR, 0.50; CI, 0.30\textendash{}0.83; P = .007) or ordered before the operation (OR, 0.52; CI, 0.30\textendash{}0.90; P = .02).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
Our data suggest that a systematic frailty-screening program effectively identifies at-risk surgical patients and is associated with a significant reduction in mortality for patients undergoing palliative care consultation. Analysis also suggests that preoperative palliative care consultations ordered by surgeons are associated with reduced mortality rates.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the need to meaningfully implement the Institute of Medicine's (IOM's) definition of health care disparity, this paper proposes statistical frameworks that lay out explicitly the needed causal assumptions for defining disparity measures. Our key emphasis is that a scientifically defensible disparity measure must take into account the direction of the causal relationship between allowable covariates that are not considered to be contributors to disparity and non-allowable covariates that are considered to be contributors to disparity, to avoid flawed disparity measures based on implausible populations that are not relevant for clinical or policy decisions. However, these causal relationships are usually unknown and undetectable from observed data. Consequently, we must make strong causal assumptions in order to proceed. Two frameworks are proposed in this paper, one is the conditional disparity framework under the assumption that allowable covariates impact non-allowable covariates but not vice versa. The other is the marginal disparity framework under the assumption that non-allowable covariates impact allowable ones but not vice versa. We establish theoretical conditions under which the two disparity measures are the same, and present a theoretical example showing that the difference between the two disparity measures can be arbitrarily large. Using data from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Survey, we also provide an example where the conditional disparity is misled by Simpson's paradox, while the marginal disparity approach handles it correctly.},

Objective: To describe how physician time is spent in ambulatory practice.
Design: Quantitative direct observational time and motion study (during office hours) and self-reported diary (after hours).
Setting: U.S. ambulatory care in 4 specialties in 4 states (Illinois, New Hampshire, Virginia, and Washington).
Participants: 57 U.S. physicians in family medicine, internal medicine, cardiology, and orthopedics who were observed for 430 hours, 21 of whom also completed after-hours diaries.
Measurements: Proportions of time spent on 4 activities (direct clinical face time, electronic health record [EHR] and desk work, administrative tasks, and other tasks) and self-reported after-hours work.
Results: During the office day, physicians spent 27.0\% of their total time on direct clinical face time with patients and 49.2\% of their time on EHR and desk work. While in the examination room with patients, physicians spent 52.9\% of the time on direct clinical face time and 37.0\% on EHR and desk work. The 21 physicians who completed after-hours diaries reported 1 to 2 hours of after-hours work each night, devoted mostly to EHR tasks.
Limitations: Data were gathered in self-selected, high-performing practices and may not be generalizable to other settings. The descriptive study design did not support formal statistical comparisons by physician and practice characteristics.
Conclusion: For every hour physicians provide direct clinical face time to patients, nearly 2 additional hours is spent on EHR and desk work within the clinic day. Outside office hours, physicians spend another 1 to 2 hours of personal time each night doing additional computer and other clerical work.

  abstract = {Socioeconomic status (SES) is frequently implicated as a contributor to the disparate health observed among racial/ ethnic minorities, women and elderly populations. Findings from studies that examine the role of SES and health disparities, however, have provided inconsistent results. This is due in part to the: 1) lack of precision and reliability of measures; 2) difficulty with the collection of individual SES data; 3) the dynamic nature of SES over a lifetime; 4) the classification of women, children, retired and unemployed persons; 5) lack of or poor correlation between individual SES measures; and 6) and inaccurate or misleading interpretation of study results. Choosing the best variable or approach for measuring SES is dependent in part on its relevance to the population and outcomes under study. Many of the commonly used compositional and contextual SES measures are limited in terms of their usefulness for examining the effect of SES on outcomes in analyses of data that include population subgroups known to experience health disparities.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of organizational leadership on the professional satisfaction and burnout of individual physicians working for a large health care organization.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We surveyed physicians and scientists working for a large health care organization in October 2013. Validated tools were used to assess burnout. Physicians also rated the leadership qualities of their immediate supervisor in 12 specific dimensions on a 5-point Likert scale. All supervisors were themselves physicians/scientists. A composite leadership score was calculated by summing scores for the 12 individual items (range, 12-60; higher scores indicate more effective leadership).
RESULTS: Of the 3896 physicians surveyed, 2813 (72.2\%) responded. Supervisor scores in each of the 12 leadership dimensions and composite leadership score strongly correlated with the burnout and satisfaction scores of individual physicians (all P$<$.001). On multivariate analysis adjusting for age, sex, duration of employment at Mayo Clinic, and specialty, each 1-point increase in composite leadership score was associated with a 3.3\% decrease in the likelihood of burnout (P$<$.001) and a 9.0\% increase in the likelihood of satisfaction (P$<$.001) of the physicians supervised. The mean composite leadership rating of each division/department chair (n=128) also correlated with the prevalence of burnout (correlation=-0.330; r(2)=0.11; P$<$.001) and satisfaction (correlation=0.684; r(2)=0.47; P$<$.001) at the division/department level.
CONCLUSION: The leadership qualities of physician supervisors appear to impact the well-being and satisfaction of individual physicians working in health care organizations. These findings have important implications for the selection and training of physician leaders and provide new insights into organizational factors that affect physician well-being.},

This study assessed the race/ethnic disparity in PCa incidence for men with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and whether the impact of metformin on PCa incidence varied by race/ethnicity. We conducted a retrospective study in 76,733 male veterans with T2D during 2003\textendash{}2012. Cox proportional hazard model adjusting for covariates and propensity scores of metformin use and race/ethnic group membership were utilized to compute the hazard ratio (HR) of PCa incidence associated with race/ethnicity, and compare HR associated with metformin use between race/ethnic groups. Mean follow-up was 6.4$\pm$2.8 years; 7\% were Hispanics; 17\% were African American (AA); mean age was 67.8$\pm$9.8 years; 5.2\% developed PCa; 38.9\% used metformin. Among these diabetic men without metformin use, PCa incidence was higher in Hispanics and AA than in non-Hispanic White (NHW). Use of metformin alone or metformin+statins was associated with a greater PCa incidence reduction in Hispanics compared to NHW, but not between AA and NHW. Use of metformin+finasteride was associated with a greater PCa incidence reduction in Hispanics and AA compared to NHW. Our results suggested that metformin treatment could be a potential strategy to reduce PCa incidence in the minority populations who are at high risk for fatal PCa. It will be important to further examine the pleiotropic effects of metformin in multi-race/ethnic prospective studies to better inform clinical management, and potentially reduce racial/ethnic disparity in PCa incidence among diabetic men.},

We sought to understand the penalty burden over the program's first five years, focusing on characteristics of hospitals that received penalties during all five years, how penalties changed over time, and the relationship between baseline and subsequent performance. More than half of participating hospitals were penalized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in all five years of the program. From fiscal years 2013 to 2017, the growth in average penalties was modest, doubling from 0.29~percent to 0.60~percent, despite increasing opportunities for penalization. The penalty burden was greater in hospitals that were urban, major teaching, large, or for-profit and that treated larger shares of Medicare or socioeconomically disadvantaged patients. Surprisingly, hospitals treating greater proportions of medically complex Medicare patients had a lower cumulative penalty burden compared to those treating fewer proportions of these patients. Lastly, we found that hospitals with high baseline penalties in the first year continued to receive significantly higher penalties in subsequent years. For many hospitals, the HRRP leads to persistent penalization and limited capacity to reduce penalty burden. Alternative structures might avoid persistent penalization, while still motivating reductions in hospital readmissions.},

  doi = {10.1097/SLA.0000000000000778},
  abstract = {Objective
To project readmission penalties for hospitals performing cardiac surgery and examine how these penalties will affect minority-serving hospitals.

Background
The Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) will potentially expand penalties for higher-than-predicted readmission rates to cardiac procedures in the near future. The impact of these penalties on minority-serving hospitals is unknown.

Methods
We examined national Medicare beneficiaries undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 2008\textendash{}2010 (N=255,250 patients, 1,186 hospitals). Using hierarchical logistic regression, we calculated hospital observed-to-expected readmission ratios. Hospital penalties were projected according to the HRRP formula using only CABG readmissions with a 3\% maximum penalty of total Medicare revenue. Hospitals were classified into quintiles according to proportion of black patients treated. Minority-serving hospitals were defined as hospitals in the top quintile while non-minority-serving hospitals those in the bottom quintile. Projected readmission penalties were compared across quintiles.

Results
Forty-seven percent of hospitals (559 of 1,186) were projected to be assessed a penalty. Twenty-eight percent of hospitals (330 of 1,186) would be penalized $<$1\% of total Medicare revenue while 5\% of hospitals (55 of 1,186) would receive the maximum 3\% penalty. Minority-serving hospitals were almost twice as likely to be penalized than non-minority-serving hospitals (61\% vs. 32\%) and were projected almost triple the reductions in reimbursement (\$112 million vs. \$41 million).

Conclusions
Minority-serving hospitals would disproportionately bear the burden of readmission penalties if expanded to include cardiac surgery. Given these hospitals' narrow profit margins, readmission penalties may have a profound impact on these hospitals' ability to care for disadvantaged patients.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From August 28, 2014, to October 6, 2014, we surveyed both US physicians and a probability-based sample of the general US population using the methods and measures used in our 2011 study. Burnout was measured using validated metrics, and satisfaction with work-life balance was assessed using standard tools.
RESULTS: Of the 35,922 physicians who received an invitation to participate, 6880 (19.2\%) completed surveys. When assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, 54.4\% (n=3680) of the physicians reported at least 1 symptom of burnout in 2014 compared with 45.5\% (n=3310) in 2011 (P$<$.001). Satisfaction with work-life balance also declined in physicians between 2011 and 2014 (48.5\% vs 40.9\%; P$<$.001). Substantial differences in rates of burnout and satisfaction with work-life balance were observed by specialty. In contrast to the trends in physicians, minimal changes in burnout or satisfaction with work-life balance were observed between 2011 and 2014 in probability-based samples of working US adults, resulting in an increasing disparity in burnout and satisfaction with work-life balance in physicians relative to the general US working population. After pooled multivariate analysis adjusting for age, sex, relationship status, and hours worked per week, physicians remained at an increased risk of burnout (odds ratio, 1.97; 95\% CI, 1.80-2.16; P$<$.001) and were less likely to be satisfied with work-life balance (odds ratio, 0.68; 95\% CI, 0.62-0.75; P$<$.001).
CONCLUSION: Burnout and satisfaction with work-life balance in US physicians worsened from 2011 to 2014. More than half of US physicians are now experiencing professional burnout.},

  abstract = {Disparities by economic status are observed in the health status and health outcomes of Medicare beneficiaries. For health services and health policy researchers, one barrier to addressing these disparities is the ability to use Medicare data to ascertain information about an individual's income level or poverty, because Medicare administrative data contains limited information about individual economic status. Information gleaned from other sources-such as the Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income programs-can be used in some cases to approximate the income of Medicare beneficiaries. However, such information is limited in its availability and applicability to all beneficiaries. Neighborhood-level measures of income can be used to infer individual-level income, but level of neighborhood aggregation impacts accuracy and usability of the data. Community-level composite measures of economic status have been shown to be associated with health and health outcomes of Medicare beneficiaries and may capture neighborhood effects that are separate from individual effects, but are not readily available in Medicare data and do not serve to replace information about individual economic status. There is no single best method of obtaining income data from Medicare files, but understanding strengths and limitations of different approaches to identifying economic status will help researchers choose the best method for their particular purpose, and help policymakers interpret studies using measures of income.},

  abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the impact of hospital value-based purchasing (HVBP) on clinical quality and patient experience during its initial implementation period (July 2011\textendash{}March 2012).

Data Sources
Hospital-level clinical quality and patient experience data from Hospital Compare from up to 5~years before and three quarters after HVBP was initiated.

Study Design
Acute care hospitals were exposed to HVBP by mandate while critical access hospitals and hospitals located in Maryland~were not exposed. We performed a difference-in-differences analysis, comparing performance on 12 incentivized clinical process and 8 incentivized patient experience measures between hospitals exposed to the program and a matched comparison group of nonexposed hospitals. We also evaluated whether hospitals that were ultimately exposed to HVBP may have anticipated the program by improving quality in advance of its introduction.

Principal Findings
Difference-in-differences estimates indicated that hospitals that were exposed to HVBP did not show greater improvement for either the clinical process or patient experience measures during the program's first implementation period. Estimates from our preferred specification showed that HVBP was associated with a 0.51 percentage point reduction in composite quality for the clinical process measures (p~$>$~.10, 95 percent CI: -1.37, 0.34) and a 0.30 percentage point reduction in composite quality for the patient experience measures (p~$>$~.10, 95 percent CI: -0.79, 0.19). We found some evidence that hospitals improved performance on clinical process measures prior to the start of HVBP, but no evidence of this phenomenon for the patient experience measures.

Conclusions
The timing of the financial incentives in HVBP was not associated with improved quality of care. It is unclear whether improvement for the clinical process measures prior to the start of HVBP was driven by the expectation of the program or was the result of other factors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND
The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship of frailty and six-month post-operative costs.

METHODS
Subjects $\geq$65 years undergoing elective colorectal operations were enrolled in a prospective observational study. Frailty was assessed by a validated measure of function, cognition, nutrition, co-morbidity burden and geriatric syndromes. Frailty was quantified by summing the number of positive characteristics in each subject.

RESULTS
Sixty subjects (mean age 75$\pm$8 years) were studied. Inpatient mortality was 2\% (n=1). Overall, 40\% (n=24) of subjects were considered non-frail, 22\% (n=13) were pre-frail and 38\% (n=22) were frail. With advancing frailty, hospital cost increased (p$<$.001) and cost from discharge to six-months increased (p$<$.001). Higher degrees of frailty were related to increased rates of discharge institutionalization (p$<$.001) and thirty-day readmission (p=.044).

CONCLUSIONS
A simple, brief pre-operative frailty assessment accurately forecasts increased surgical hospital costs and post-discharge to six-month healthcare costs following colorectal operations in older adults.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate clinical documentation (CD) is necessary for many aspects of modern health care, including excellent communication, quality metrics reporting, and legal documentation. New requirements have mandated adoption of ICD-10-CM coding systems, adding another layer of complexity to CD. A clinical documentation improvement (CDI) and ICD-10 training program was created for health care providers in our academic surgery department. We aimed to assess the impact of our CDI curriculum by comparing quality metrics, coding, and reimbursement before and after implementation of our CDI program.
STUDY DESIGN: A CDI/ICD-10 training curriculum was instituted in September 2014 for all members of our university surgery department. The curriculum consisted of didactic lectures, 1-on-1 provider training, case reviews, e-learning modules, and CD queries from nurse CDI staff and hospital coders. Outcomes parameters included monthly documentation completion rates, severity of illness (SOI), risk of mortality (ROM), case-mix index (CMI), all-payer refined diagnosis-related groups (APR-DRG), and Surgical Care Improvement Program (SCIP) metrics. Financial gain from responses to CDI queries was determined retrospectively.
RESULTS: Surgery department delinquent documentation decreased by 85\% after CDI implementation. Compliance with SCIP measures improved from 85\% to 97\%. Significant increases in surgical SOI, ROM, CMI, and APR-DRG (all p $<$ 0.01) were found after CDI/ICD-10 training implementation. Provider responses to CDI queries resulted in an estimated \$4,672,786 increase in charges.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical documentation improvement/ICD-10 training in an academic surgery department is an effective method to improve documentation rates, increase the hospital estimated reimbursement based on more accurate CD, and provide better compliance with surgical quality measures.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The decision as to whether a patient can tolerate surgery is often subjective and can misjudge a patient's true physiologic state. The concept of frailty is an important assessment tool in the geriatric medical population, but has only recently gained attention in surgical patients. Frailty potentially represents a measureable phenotype, which, if quantified with a standardized protocol, could reliably estimate the risk of adverse surgical outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN: Frailty was prospectively evaluated in the clinic setting in patients consenting for major general, oncologic, and urologic procedures. Evaluation included an established assessment tool (Hopkins Frailty Score), self-administered questionnaires, clinical assessment of performance status, and biochemical measures. Primary outcome was 30-day postoperative complications.
RESULTS: There were 189 patients evaluated: 117 from urology, 52 from surgical oncology, and 20 from general surgery clinics. Mean age was 62 years, 59.8\% were male, and 71.4\% were Caucasian. Patients who scored intermediately frail or frail on the Hopkins Frailty Score were more likely to experience postoperative complications (odds ratio [OR] 2.07, 95\% CI 1.05 to 4.08, p = 0.036). Of all other preoperative assessment tools, only higher hemoglobin (p = 0.033) had a significant association and was protective for 30-day complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The aggregate score of patients as "intermediately frail or frail" on the Hopkins Frailty Score was predictive of a patient experiencing a postoperative complication. This preoperative assessment tool may prove beneficial when weighing the risks and benefits of surgery, allowing objective data to guide surgical decision-making and patient counseling.},

  abstract = {Introduction
Our purpose was to determine the relationship between pre-operative frailty and the occurrence of postoperative complications following colorectal and cardiac operations.

Study Design
Patients $\geq$65 years undergoing elective colorectal or cardiac surgery were enrolled. Seven baseline frailty traits were measured pre-operatively: Katz Score $\leq$5, Timed Up-and-Go $\geq$15 seconds, Charlson Index $\geq$3, anemia$<$35\%, Mini-Cog score $\leq$3, albumin$<$3.4gm/dL and $\geq$1 fall within six-months. Patients were categorized by the number of positive traits: non-frail: 0\textendash{}1 trait, pre-frail: 2\textendash{}3 traits and frail: $\geq$4 traits.

Results
201 subjects (age 74$\pm$6 years) were studied. Preoperative frailty was associated with increased postoperative complications following colorectal (non-frail 21\%, pre-frail 40\% and frail 58\%; p=0.016) and cardiac operations (non-frail 17\%, pre-frail 28\% and frail 56\%; p$<$0.001). This finding in both groups was independent of advancing age. Frail individuals in both groups had longer hospital stays and higher 30-day readmission rates. Receiver operating characteristic curves examining frailty's ability to forecast complications were: colorectal (0.702; p=0.004) and cardiac (0.711; p$<$0.001).

Conclusion
A simple pre-operative frailty score defines older adults at higher risk for postoperative complications across surgical specialties.},

  abstract = {Introduction
Frailty is a state of increased vulnerability to health-related stressors and can be measured by summing the number of frailty characteristics present in an individual. Discharge institutionalization (rather than discharge to home) represents disease burden and functional dependence following hospitalization. Our aim was to determine the relationship between frailty and need for post-operative discharge institutionalization.

Study Design
Subjects $\geq$65 years undergoing major elective operations requiring post-operative ICU admission were enrolled. Discharge institutionalization was defined as need for institutionalized care at hospital discharge. Fourteen pre-operative frailty characteristics were measured in six domains: co-morbidity burden, function, nutrition, cognition geriatric syndromes and extrinsic frailty.

Results
223 subjects (mean age 73$\pm$6 years) were studied. Discharge institutionalization occurred in 30\% (66). Frailty characteristics related to need for post-operative discharge institutionalization included: older age, Charlson $\geq$3, Hematocrit $<$35\%, any functional dependence, Up-and-Go $\geq$15 seconds, albumin $<$3.4 mg/dL, Mini-Cog $\leq$3, and having fallen within six-months (p$<$.0001 for all comparisons). Multivariate logistic regression retained prolonged timed up-and-go (p$<$.0001) and any functional dependence (p$<$.0001) as the variables most closely related to need for discharge institutionalization. An increased number of frailty characteristics present in any one subject resulted in increased rate of discharge institutionalization.

Conclusions
Nearly one in three geriatric patients required discharge to an institutional care facility following major surgery. The frailty characteristics of prolonged up-and-go and any functional dependence were most closely related to the need for discharge institutionalization. Accumulation of a higher number of frailty characteristics in any one geriatric patient increased their risk of discharge institutionalization.},

Aged animals had a higher FI than younger animals (FI = 0.43 $\pm$ 0.03 vs 0.08 $\pm$ 0.02, p $<$ .001, n = 12). Myocyte hypertrophy increased by 30\%-50\% as the FI increased in aged animals. Peak contractions decreased more than threefold from lowest to highest FI values in aged mice (p $<$ .037), but calcium transients were unaffected. Similar results were seen with an FI based on eight noninvasive variables identified as underlying factors. These results show that an FI can be developed for murine models and suggest that age-associated changes in myocytes are more prominent in animals with a high FI.},

However, there are no structured reporting requirements for studies of this design to assist authors, editors, and readers. The authors developed and tested a checklist of criteria related to threats to the internal and external validity of observational longitudinal studies. The checklist criteria concerned recruitment, data collection, biases, and data analysis and descriptive issues relevant to study rationale, study population, and generalizability. Two raters independently assessed 49 randomly selected articles describing stroke research published from 1999 to 2003 in six journals: American Journal of Epidemiology, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, Stroke, Annals of Neurology, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. On average, 17 of the 33 checklist criteria were reported. Criteria describing the study design were better reported than those related to internal validity. No relation was found between study type (etiologic or prognostic) or word count and quality of reporting. A flow diagram for summarizing participant flow through a study was developed. Editors and authors should consider using a checklist and flow diagram when reporting on observational longitudinal research.},

We describe the development of a reporting guideline, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols 2015 (PRISMA-P 2015). PRISMA-P consists of a 17-item checklist intended to facilitate the preparation and reporting of a robust protocol for the systematic review. Funders and those commissioning reviews might consider mandating the use of the checklist to facilitate the submission of relevant protocol information in funding applications. Similarly, peer reviewers and editors can use the guidance to gauge the completeness and transparency of a systematic review protocol submitted for publication in a journal or other medium.},

  abstract = {Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential to summarise evidence relating to efficacy and safety of healthcare interventions accurately and reliably. The clarity and transparency of these reports, however, are not optimal. Poor reporting of systematic reviews diminishes their value to clinicians, policy makers, and other users.
Since the development of the QUOROM (quality of reporting of meta-analysis) statement\textemdash{}a reporting guideline published in 1999\textemdash{}there have been several conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported. Realising these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evaluations of health care interventions.
The PRISMA statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review. In this explanation and elaboration document, we explain the meaning and rationale for each checklist item. For each item, we include an example of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature. The PRISMA statement, this document, and the associated website (www.prisma-statement.org/) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.},

The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalizability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE Statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the web sites of PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Epidemiology. We hope that the STROBE Statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.},

  title = {Accumulation of {{Deficits}} as a {{Proxy Measure}} of {{Aging}}},
  abstract = {This paper develops a method for appraising health status in elderly people. A frailty index was defined as the proportion of accumulated deficits (symptoms, signs, functional impairments, and laboratory abnormalities). It serves as an individual state variable, reflecting severity of illness and proximity to death. In a representative database of elderly Canadians we found that deficits accumulated at 3\% per year, and show a gamma distribution, typical for systems with redundant components that can be used in case of failure of a given subsystem. Of note, the slope of the index is insensitive to the individual nature of the deficits, and serves as an important prognostic factor for life expectancy. The formula for estimating an individual\dbend{}s life span given the frailty index value is presented. For different patterns of cognitive impairments the average within-group index value increases with the severity of the cognitive impairment, and the relative variability of the index is significantly reduced. Finally, the statistical distribution of the frailty index sharply differs between well groups (gamma distribution) and morbid groups (normal distribution). This pattern reflects an increase in uncompensated deficits in impaired organisms, which would lead to illness of various etiologies, and ultimately to increased mortality. The accumulation of deficits is as an example of a macroscopic variable, i.e., one that reflects general properties of aging at the level of the whole organism rather than any given functional deficiency. In consequence, we propose that it may be used as a proxy measure of aging.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jss.2015.10.026},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Women have poorer outcomes after vascular surgery as compared to men as shown by studies recently. Frailty is also an independent risk factor for postoperative morbidity and mortality. This study examines the interplay of gender and frailty on outcomes after infrainguinal vascular procedures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was used to identify all patients who underwent infrainguinal vascular procedures from 2005-2012. Frailty was measured using a modified frailty index (mFI; derived from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging). Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to investigate the association of preoperative frailty and gender, on postoperative outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 24,645 patients (92\% open, 8\% endovascular), there were 533 deaths (2.2\%) and 6198 (25.1\%) major complications within 30 d postoperatively. Women were more frail (mean mFI = 0.269) than men (mean mFI = 0.259; P $<$ 0.001). Women and frail patients (mFI$>$0.25) were more likely to have a major morbidity (P $<$ 0.001) or mortality (P $<$ 0.001) with the highest risk in frail women. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, female gender and increasing mFI were independently significantly associated with mortality (P $<$ 0.05) as well as major complications. The interaction of gender and frailty in multivariate analysis showed the highest adjusted 30-d mortality and morbidity in frail females at 2.8\% and 30.1\%, respectively and that was significantly higher (P $<$ 0.001) than nonfrail males, nonfrail females and frail males.
CONCLUSIONS: Female gender and frailty are both associated with increased risk of complications and death following infrainguinal vascular procedures with the highest risk in frail females. Further studies are needed to explore the mechanisms of interaction of gender and frailty and its effect on long-term outcomes for peripheral vascular disease.},

  issn = {0003-4819},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major surgical procedures are performed with increasing frequency in elderly persons, but the impact of age on resource use and outcomes is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of age on perioperative cardiac and noncardiac complications and length of stay in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Urban academic medical center.
PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 4315 patients 50 years of age or older who underwent nonemergent major noncardiac procedures.
MEASUREMENTS: Major perioperative complications (cardiac and noncardiac), in-hospital mortality, and length of stay.
RESULTS: Major perioperative complications occurred in 4.3\% (44 of 1015) of patients 59 years of age or younger, 5.7\% (93 of 1646) of patients 60 to 69 years of age, 9.6\% (129 of 1341) of patients 70 to 79 years of age, and 12.5\% (39 of 313) of patients 80 years of age or older (P $<$ 0.001). In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients 80 years of age or older than in those younger than 80 years of age (0.7\% vs. 2.6\%, respectively). Multivariate analyses indicated an increased odds ratio for perioperative complications or in-hospital mortality in patients 70 to 79 years of age (1.8 [95\% CI, 1.2 to 2.7]) and those 80 years of age or older (OR, 2.1 [CI, 1.2 to 3.6]) compared with patients 50 to 59 years of age. Patients 80 years of age or older stayed an average of 1 day more in the hospital, after adjustment for other clinical data (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients had a higher rate of major perioperative complications and mortality after noncardiac surgery and a longer length of stay, but even in patients 80 years of age or older, mortality was low.},

Patient characteristics, including age, sex, expected payment source, duration of surgery, and discharge disposition are presented, as well as the number and types of procedures performed in these settings. Methods-Estimates in this report are based on ambulatory surgery data collected in the 2010 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS). NHAMCS has collected outpatient department and emergency department data since 1992 and began gathering ambulatory surgery data from both hospitals and ASCs in 2010. Sample data were weighted to produce annual national estimates. Results-In 2010, 48.3 million surgical and nonsurgical procedures were performed during 28.6 million ambulatory surgery visits to hospitals and ASCs combined. For both males and females, 39\% of procedures were performed on those aged 45-64. For females, about 24\% of procedures were performed on those aged 15-44 compared with 18\% for males, whereas the percentage of procedures performed on those under 15 was lower for females than for males (4\% compared with 9\%). About 19\% of procedures were performed on those aged 65-74, while about 14\% were performed on those aged 75 and over. Private insurance was listed as the principal expected source of payment for 51\% of ambulatory surgery visits, Medicare for 31\% of visits, and Medicaid for 8\% of visits. The most frequently performed procedures included endoscopy of large intestine (4.0 million), endoscopy of small intestine (2.2 million), extraction of lens (2.9 million), insertion of prosthetic lens (2.6 million), and injection of agent into spinal canal (2.9 million). Only 2\% of visits with a discharge status were admitted to the hospital as an inpatient.},

  volume = {43},
  issn = {0025-7079},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Implementation of the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) coding system presents challenges for using administrative data. Recognizing this, we conducted a multistep process to develop ICD-10 coding algorithms to define Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities in administrative data and assess the performance of the resulting algorithms.
METHODS: ICD-10 coding algorithms were developed by "translation" of the ICD-9-CM codes constituting Deyo's (for Charlson comorbidities) and Elixhauser's coding algorithms and by physicians' assessment of the face-validity of selected ICD-10 codes. The process of carefully developing ICD-10 algorithms also produced modified and enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithms for the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities. We then used data on in-patients aged 18 years and older in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10 administrative hospital discharge data from a Canadian health region to assess the comorbidity frequencies and mortality prediction achieved by the original ICD-9-CM algorithms, the enhanced ICD-9-CM algorithms, and the new ICD-10 coding algorithms.
RESULTS: Among 56,585 patients in the ICD-9-CM data and 58,805 patients in the ICD-10 data, frequencies of the 17 Charlson comorbidities and the 30 Elixhauser comorbidities remained generally similar across algorithms. The new ICD-10 and enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithms either matched or outperformed the original Deyo and Elixhauser ICD-9-CM coding algorithms in predicting in-hospital mortality. The C-statistic was 0.842 for Deyo's ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.860 for the ICD-10 coding algorithm, and 0.859 for the enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.868 for the original Elixhauser ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.870 for the ICD-10 coding algorithm and 0.878 for the enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithm.
CONCLUSIONS: These newly developed ICD-10 and ICD-9-CM comorbidity coding algorithms produce similar estimates of comorbidity prevalence in administrative data, and may outperform existing ICD-9-CM coding algorithms.},

Valid inferences from such data require the ability to account for disease severity and comorbid conditions. We adapted a clinical comorbidity index, designed for use with medical records, for research relying on International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis and procedure codes. The association of this adapted index with health outcomes and resource use was then examined with a sample of Medicare beneficiaries who underwent lumbar spine surgery in 1985 (n = 27,111). The index was associated in the expected direction with postoperative complications, mortality, blood transfusion, discharge to nursing home, length of hospital stay, and hospital charges. These associations were observed whether the index incorporated data from multiple hospitalizations over a year's time, or just from the index surgical admission. They also persisted after controlling for patient age. We conclude that the adapted comorbidity index will be useful in studies of disease outcome and resource use employing administrative databases.},

The only direct test of E2's protective effect in mice against in vivo oxidative stress to date may have been confounded by E2's direct chemical action as an antioxidant because it was administered at very high dosages. Therefore, we have identified a low yet physiologically effective dose of E2. We then administered this dose using subcutaneous time-release pellets to ovariectomized mice. Two weeks after E2 pellet implantation, sham-operated, ovariectomized, and ovariectomized E2-supplemented female mice were injected with a lethal dose of paraquat and their survival was followed. It was observed that ovariectomy exacerbates paraquat-induced mortality and is rescued by E2 supplementation. An equivalent experiment was performed on sham-operated, orchidectomized, and E2-supplemented orchidectomized male mice. The survival of male mice was improved by orchidectomy, and E2 gave no further benefit. We interpret the results to mean that E2 is protective against oxidative stress through its regulatory role and that testosterone diminishes protection against oxidative stress.},

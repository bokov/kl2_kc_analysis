## Starting 6 word daily work journal.	

Every workday starting today I'm going to try to log what I did and why in six or more words (not counting this sentence).

I worked on [DataFinisher](https://github.com/UTHSCSA-CIRD/datafinisher/tree/f_infocol) and I think I figured out what I need to do in order to have the option of multiple output columns being derived from each input column. To do next:

* Have `rules.py` somehow specify multiple columns
* Implement active/inactive diags

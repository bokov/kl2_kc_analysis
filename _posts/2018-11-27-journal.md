## Starting 6 word daily work journal.	

Every workday starting today I'm going to try to log what I did and why in six or more words (not counting this sentence).

I worked on [DataFinisher](https://github.com/UTHSCSA-CIRD/datafinisher/tree/f_infocol) and I think I figured out what I need to do in order to have the option of multiple output columns being derived from each input column. 

Also, figured out how to implement [RStudio-style code-folding sections for Python using the Kate text editor](https://gist.github.com/bokov/71392f18e3b6aadac06edf037c003504) (will likely work for syntax highlight configs of other languages supported by Kate).

To do next:

* Have `rules.py` somehow specify multiple columns
* Implement active/inactive diags
* In `rules.py` create list of allowed rules (as opposed to recommended) (i.e. which rules to offer on a future GUI menu for each column)
* Merge in a supplementary rules file that overrides `rules.py`
* A script to hide/scrub the meta/info cells so I can look over the data in its current state and see what additional defaults are needed.
* A prototype shiny app that reads the the allowed rules from `rules.py` and presents pulldown menus

In attendance: Dr. Tsevat, Dr. Dougherty, and Ms. Wray

I brought a printout of [my Aim 2 results so far](https://rpubs.com/bokov/kidneycancer) and [a progress report](/files/180926_bokov_kl2leadership_mtg.docx).

Notes:
* The mandatory CTSA meeting I will be attending is in spring 2019. The abstract deadline will be in January.
* There was some discussion of courses. One suggestion was that I go for (another) M.S., because it might not take that many courses given that I would place out of many of them. The advantage would be that I would not have to go through the (presumably cumbersome?) non-degree student process. The disadvantage is that the tuition would take a significant chunk of research budget which I also need to cover lodging during my externship and my travel to CTSA.
* The history behind some of the older KL2 proposals having a large portfolio of courses is that in 2011 the CTSA released a set of 97 core competencies that translational researchers should have, and the default path for a KL2 scholar was an MS program. Since then the need for an individualized curriculum has been recognized, so I really need to focus on the course or courses that I will actually need for my career as a scientist.
* I pointed out that the course from my original list I would like to enroll in does prominently feature using electronic medical records in research.

Action items from this meeting:
1. I need to separate the Timeline/Progress section into research vs. non-research activities.
2. It was suggested I should read some systematic reviews of the management of kidney cancer (in addition to what I already have in my collection).
3. MS curriculum is organized in modules. I need to find out when and by whom the kidney cancer modules are taught and ask Dr. Rodriguez about auditing just those modules. Probably about 3-6 lectures, much less time commitment than a full course.
4. I will talk to the IRB folks about whether or not they feel it is necessary for me to take the course Dr. Summers teaches for MSCI
5. I need to set up a meeting with Ms. Wray to figure out the logistics of enrolling in an MS course (after talking to Dr. Rodriguez) and get her suggestions on better organizing my progress report.
